the tooltip is displayed at that x-position.  Otherwise it is
displayed at the mouse position, with offset DX added (default is 5 if
DX isn't specified).  Likewise for the y-position; if a `top' frame
parameter is specified, it determines the y-position of the tooltip
window, otherwise it is displayed at the mouse position, with offset
DY added (default is -10).

A tooltip's maximum size is specified by `x-max-tooltip-size'.

The shape of the pointer when over text.
Changing the value does not affect existing frames
unless you set the mouse color.Vx-resource-name
The name Emacs uses to look up X resources.
`x-get-resource' uses this as the first component of the instance name
when requesting resource values.
Emacs initially sets `x-resource-name' to the name under which Emacs
was invoked, or to the value specified with the `-name' or `-rn'
switches, if present.

It may be useful to bind this variable locally around a call
to `x-get-resource'.  See also the variable `x-resource-class'.Vx-resource-class
The class Emacs uses to look up X resources.
`x-get-resource' uses this as the first component of the instance class
when requesting resource values.
Emacs initially sets `x-resource-class' to "Emacs".

Setting this variable permanently is not a reasonable thing to do,
but binding this variable locally around a call to `x-get-resource'
is a reasonable practice.  See also the variable `x-resource-name'.Vx-nontext-pointer-shape
The shape of the pointer when not over text.
This variable takes effect when you create a new frame
or when you set the mouse color.Vx-hourglass-pointer-shape
The shape of the pointer when Emacs is busy.
This variable takes effect when you create a new frame
or when you set the mouse color.Vdisplay-hourglass

Emacs doesn't try to figure this out; this is always nil
unless you set it to something else.Vx-pixel-size-width-font-regexp
Regexp matching a font name whose width is the same as `PIXEL_SIZE'.

Since Emacs gets width of a font matching with this regexp from
PIXEL_SIZE field of the name, font finding mechanism gets faster for
such a font.  This is especially effective for such large fonts as
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.Vimage-cache-eviction-delay
Time after which cached images are removed from the cache.
When an image has not been displayed this many seconds, remove it
from the image cache.  Value must be an integer or nil with nil
meaning don't clear the cache.Vmotif-version-string
Version info for LessTif/Motif.Fx-popup-menu
Pop up a deck-of-cards menu and return user's selection.
POSITION is a position specification.  This is either a mouse button event
or a list ((XOFFSET YOFFSET) WINDOW)
where XOFFSET and YOFFSET are positions in pixels from the top left
corner of WINDOW's frame.  (WINDOW may be a frame object instead of a window.)
This controls the position of the center of the first line
in the first pane of the menu, not the top left of the menu as a whole.
If POSITION is t, it means to use the current mouse position.

MENU is a specifier for a menu.  For the simplest case, MENU is a keymap.
The menu items come from key bindings that have a menu string as well as
a definition; actually, the "definition" in such a key binding looks like
(STRING . REAL-DEFINITION).  To give the menu a title, put a string into
the keymap as a top-level element.

If REAL-DEFINITION is nil, that puts a nonselectable string in the menu.
Otherwise, REAL-DEFINITION should be a valid key binding definition.

You can also use a list of keymaps as MENU.
  Then each keymap makes a separate pane.
When MENU is a keymap or a list of keymaps, the return value
is a list of events.


Alternatively, you can specify a menu of multiple panes
  with a list of the form (TITLE PANE1 PANE2...),
where each pane is a list of form (TITLE ITEM1 ITEM2...).
Each ITEM is normally a cons cell (STRING . VALUE);
but a string can appear as an item--that makes a nonselectable line
in the menu.
With this form of menu, the return value is VALUE from the chosen item.

If POSITION is nil, don't display the menu at all, just precalculate the
cached information about equivalent key sequences.

(x-popup-menu POSITION MENU)Fx-popup-dialog
Pop up a dialog box and return user's selection.
POSITION specifies which frame to use.
This is normally a mouse button event or a window or frame.
If POSITION is t, it means to use the frame the mouse is on.
The dialog box appears in the middle of the specified frame.

CONTENTS specifies the alternatives to display in the dialog box.
It is a list of the form (TITLE ITEM1 ITEM2...).
Each ITEM is a cons cell (STRING . VALUE).
The return value is VALUE from the chosen item.

An ITEM may also be just a string--that makes a nonselectable item.
An ITEM may also be nil--that means to put all preceding items
on the left of the dialog box and all following items on the right.
(By default, approximately half appear on each side.)

(x-popup-dialog POSITION CONTENTS)Vmenu-updating-frame
Frame for which we are updating a menu.
The enable predicate for a menu command should check this variable.Fx-own-selection-internal
Assert an X selection of the given TYPE with the given VALUE.
TYPE is a symbol, typically `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD'.
(Those are literal upper-case symbol names, since that's what X expects.)
VALUE is typically a string, or a cons of two markers, but may be
anything that the functions on `selection-converter-alist' know about.

(x-own-selection-internal SELECTION-NAME SELECTION-VALUE)Fx-get-selection-internal
Return text selected from some X window.
SELECTION is a symbol, typically `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD'.
(Those are literal upper-case symbol names, since that's what X expects.)
TYPE is the type of data desired, typically `STRING'.

(x-get-selection-internal SELECTION-SYMBOL TARGET-TYPE)Fx-disown-selection-internal
If we own the selection SELECTION, disown it.
Disowning it means there is no such selection.

(x-disown-selection-internal SELECTION &optional TIME)Fx-selection-owner-p
Whether the current Emacs process owns the given X Selection.
The arg should be the name of the selection in question, typically one of
the symbols `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD'.
(Those are literal upper-case symbol names, since that's what X expects.)
For convenience, the symbol nil is the same as `PRIMARY',
and t is the same as `SECONDARY'.)

(x-selection-owner-p &optional SELECTION)Fx-selection-exists-p
Whether there is an owner for the given X Selection.
The arg should be the name of the selection in question, typically one of
the symbols `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD'.
(Those are literal upper-case symbol names, since that's what X expects.)
For convenience, the symbol nil is the same as `PRIMARY',
and t is the same as `SECONDARY'.)

(x-selection-exists-p &optional SELECTION)Fx-get-cut-buffer-internal
Returns the value of the named cut buffer (typically CUT_BUFFER0).

(x-get-cut-buffer-internal BUFFER)Fx-store-cut-buffer-internal
Sets the value of the named cut buffer (typically CUT_BUFFER0).

(x-store-cut-buffer-internal BUFFER STRING)Fx-rotate-cut-buffers-internal
Rotate the values of the cut buffers by the given number of step.
Positive means shift the values forward, negative means backward.

(x-rotate-cut-buffers-internal N)Vselection-converter-alist
An alist associating X Windows selection-types with functions.
These functions are called to convert the selection, with three args:
the name of the selection (typically `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD');
a desired type to which the selection should be converted;
and the local selection value (whatever was given to `x-own-selection').

The function should return the value to send to the X server
(typically a string).  A return value of nil
means that the conversion could not be done.
A return value which is the symbol `NULL'
means that a side-effect was executed,
and there is no meaningful selection value.Vx-lost-selection-hooks
A list of functions to be called when Emacs loses an X selection.
(This happens when some other X client makes its own selection
or when a Lisp program explicitly clears the selection.)
The functions are called with one argument, the selection type
(a symbol, typically `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD').Vx-sent-selection-hooks
A list of functions to be called when Emacs answers a selection request.
The functions are called with four arguments:
  - the selection name (typically `PRIMARY', `SECONDARY', or `CLIPBOARD');
  - the selection-type which Emacs was asked to convert the
    selection into before sending (for example, `STRING' or `LENGTH');
  - a flag indicating success or failure for responding to the request.
We might have failed (and declined the request) for any number of reasons,
including being asked for a selection that we no longer own, or being asked
to convert into a type that we don't know about or that is inappropriate.
This hook doesn't let you change the behavior of Emacs's selection replies,
it merely informs you that they have happened.Vselection-coding-system
Coding system for communicating with other X clients.
When sending or receiving text via cut_buffer, selection, and clipboard,
the text is encoded or decoded by this coding system.
The default value is `compound-text'.Vnext-selection-coding-system
Coding system for the next communication with other X clients.
Usually, `selection-coding-system' is used for communicating with
other X clients.   But, if this variable is set, it is used for the
next communication only.   After the communication, this variable is
set to nil.Vx-selection-timeout
Number of milliseconds to wait for a selection reply.
If the selection owner doesn't reply in this time, we give up.
A value of 0 means wait as long as necessary.  This is initialized from the
"*selectionTimeout" resource.Fdump-redisplay-history
Dump redisplay history to stderr.

(dump-redisplay-history)Fredraw-frame
Clear frame FRAME and output again what is supposed to appear on it.

(redraw-frame FRAME)Fredraw-display
Clear and redisplay all visible frames.

(redraw-display)Fopen-termscript
Start writing all terminal output to FILE as well as the terminal.
FILE = nil means just close any termscript file currently open.

(open-termscript FILE)Fsend-string-to-terminal
Send STRING to the terminal without alteration.
Control characters in STRING will have terminal-dependent effects.

(send-string-to-terminal STRING)Fding
Beep, or flash the screen.
Also, unless an argument is given,
terminate any keyboard macro currently executing.

(ding &optional ARG)Fsleep-for
Pause, without updating display, for SECONDS seconds.
SECONDS may be a floating-point value, meaning that you can wait for a
fraction of a second.  Optional second arg MILLISECONDS specifies an
additional wait period, in milliseconds; this may be useful if your
Emacs was built without floating point support.
(Not all operating systems support waiting for a fraction of a second.)

(sleep-for SECONDS &optional MILLISECONDS)Fsit-for
Perform redisplay, then wait for SECONDS seconds or until input is available.
SECONDS may be a floating-point value, meaning that you can wait for a
fraction of a second.  Optional second arg MILLISECONDS specifies an
additional wait period, in milliseconds; this may be useful if your
Emacs was built without floating point support.
(Not all operating systems support waiting for a fraction of a second.)
Optional third arg NODISP non-nil means don't redisplay, just wait for input.
Redisplay is preempted as always if input arrives, and does not happen
if input is available before it starts.
Value is t if waited the full time with no input arriving.

(sit-for SECONDS &optional MILLISECONDS NODISP)Fframe-or-buffer-changed-p
Return non-nil if the frame and buffer state appears to have changed.
The state variable is an internal vector containing all frames and buffers,
aside from buffers whose names start with space,
along with the buffers' read-only and modified flags, which allows a fast
check to see whether the menu bars might need to be recomputed.
If this function returns non-nil, it updates the internal vector to reflect
the current state.


(frame-or-buffer-changed-p)Finternal-show-cursor
Set the cursor-visibility flag of WINDOW to SHOW.
WINDOW nil means use the selected window.  SHOW non-nil means
show a cursor in WINDOW in the next redisplay.  SHOW nil means
don't show a cursor.

(internal-show-cursor WINDOW SHOW)Finternal-show-cursor-p
Value is non-nil if next redisplay will display a cursor in WINDOW.
WINDOW nil or omitted means report on the selected window.

(internal-show-cursor-p &optional WINDOW)Vbaud-rate
*The output baud rate of the terminal.
On most systems, changing this value will affect the amount of padding
and the other strategic decisions made during redisplay.Vinverse-video
*Non-nil means invert the entire frame display.
This means everything is in inverse video which otherwise would not be.Vvisible-bell
*Non-nil means try to flash the frame to represent a bell.

See also `ring-bell-function'.Vno-redraw-on-reenter
*Non-nil means no need to redraw entire frame after suspending.
A non-nil value is useful if the terminal can automatically preserve
Emacs's frame display when you reenter Emacs.
It is up to you to set this variable if your terminal can do that.Vwindow-system
A symbol naming the window-system under which Emacs is running
(such as `x'), or nil if emacs is running on an ordinary terminal.Vwindow-system-version
The version number of the window system in use.
For X windows, this is 10 or 11.Vcursor-in-echo-area
Non-nil means put cursor in minibuffer, at end of any message there.Vglyph-table
Table defining how to output a glyph code to the frame.
If not nil, this is a vector indexed by glyph code to define the glyph.
Each element can be:
 integer: a glyph code which this glyph is an alias for.
 string: output this glyph using that string (not impl. in X windows).
 nil: this glyph mod 524288 is the code of a character to output,
    and this glyph / 524288 is the face number (see `face-id') to use
    while outputting it.Vstandard-display-table
Display table to use for buffers that specify none.
See `buffer-display-table' for more information.Vredisplay-dont-pause
*Non-nil means update isn't paused when input is detected.Fframep
Return non-nil if OBJECT is a frame.
Value is t for a termcap frame (a character-only terminal),
`x' for an Emacs frame that is really an X window,
`w32' for an Emacs frame that is a window on MS-Windows display,
`mac' for an Emacs frame on a Macintosh display,
`pc' for a direct-write MS-DOS frame.
See also `frame-live-p'.

(framep OBJECT)Fframe-live-p
Return non-nil if OBJECT is a frame which has not been deleted.
Value is nil if OBJECT is not a live frame.  If object is a live
frame, the return value indicates what sort of output device it is
displayed on.  Value is t for a termcap frame (a character-only
terminal), `x' for an Emacs frame being displayed in an X window.

(frame-live-p OBJECT)Fmake-terminal-frame
Create an additional terminal frame.
You can create multiple frames on a text-only terminal in this way.
Only the selected terminal frame is actually displayed.
This function takes one argument, an alist specifying frame parameters.
In practice, generally you don't need to specify any parameters.
Note that changing the size of one terminal frame automatically affects all.

(make-terminal-frame PARMS)Fselect-frame
Select the frame FRAME.
Subsequent editing commands apply to its selected window.
The selection of FRAME lasts until the next time the user does
something to select a different frame, or until the next time this
function is called.

(select-frame FRAME &optional NO-ENTER)Fhandle-switch-frame
Handle a switch-frame event EVENT.
Switch-frame events are usually bound to this function.
A switch-frame event tells Emacs that the window manager has requested
that the user's events be directed to the frame mentioned in the event.
This function selects the selected window of the frame of EVENT.

If EVENT is frame object, handle it as if it were a switch-frame event
to that frame.

(handle-switch-frame EVENT &optional NO-ENTER)Fignore-event
Do nothing, but preserve any prefix argument already specified.
This is a suitable binding for iconify-frame and make-frame-visible.

(ignore-event)Fselected-frame
Return the frame that is now selected.

(selected-frame)Fwindow-frame
Return the frame object that window WINDOW is on.

(window-frame WINDOW)Fframe-first-window
Returns the topmost, leftmost window of FRAME.
If omitted, FRAME defaults to the currently selected frame.

(frame-first-window &optional FRAME)Factive-minibuffer-window
Return the currently active minibuffer window, or nil if none.

(active-minibuffer-window)Fframe-root-window
Returns the root-window of FRAME.
If omitted, FRAME defaults to the currently selected frame.

(frame-root-window &optional FRAME)Fframe-selected-window
Return the selected window of frame object FRAME.
If omitted, FRAME defaults to the currently selected frame.

(frame-selected-window &optional FRAME)Fset-frame-selected-window
Set the selected window of frame object FRAME to WINDOW.
If FRAME is nil, the selected frame is used.
If FRAME is the selected frame, this makes WINDOW the selected window.

(set-frame-selected-window FRAME WINDOW)Fframe-list
Return a list of all frames.

(frame-list)Fnext-frame
Return the next frame in the frame list after FRAME.
It considers only frames on the same terminal as FRAME.
By default, skip minibuffer-only frames.
If omitted, FRAME defaults to the selected frame.
If optional argument MINIFRAME is nil, exclude minibuffer-only frames.
If MINIFRAME is a window, include only its own frame
and any frame now using that window as the minibuffer.
If MINIFRAME is `visible', include all visible frames.
If MINIFRAME is 0, include all visible and iconified frames.
Otherwise, include all frames.

(next-frame &optional FRAME MINIFRAME)Fprevious-frame
Return the previous frame in the frame list before FRAME.
It considers only frames on the same terminal as FRAME.
By default, skip minibuffer-only frames.
If omitted, FRAME defaults to the selected frame.
If optional argument MINIFRAME is nil, exclude minibuffer-only frames.
If MINIFRAME is a window, include only its own frame
and any frame now using that window as the minibuffer.
If MINIFRAME is `visible', include all visible frames.
If MINIFRAME is 0, include all visible and iconified frames.
Otherwise, include all frames.

(previous-frame &optional FRAME MINIFRAME)Fdelete-frame
Delete FRAME, permanently eliminating it from use.
If omitted, FRAME defaults to the selected frame.
A frame may not be deleted if its minibuffer is used by other frames.
Normally, you may not delete a frame if all other frames are invisible,
but if the second optional argument FORCE is non-nil, you may do so.

This function runs `delete-frame-hook' before actually deleting the
frame.  The hook is called with one argument FRAME.

(delete-frame &optional FRAME FORCE)Fmouse-position
Return a list (FRAME X . Y) giving the current mouse frame and position.
The position is given in character cells, where (0, 0) is the
upper-left corner.
If Emacs is running on a mouseless terminal or hasn't been programmed
to read the mouse position, it returns the selected frame for FRAME
and nil for X and Y.
If `mouse-position-function' is non-nil, `mouse-position' calls it,
passing the normal return value to that function as an argument,
and returns whatever that function returns.

(mouse-position)Fmouse-pixel-position
Return a list (FRAME X . Y) giving the current mouse frame and position.
The position is given in pixel units, where (0, 0) is the
upper-left corner.
If Emacs is running on a mouseless terminal or hasn't been programmed
to read the mouse position, it returns the selected frame for FRAME
and nil for X and Y.

(mouse-pixel-position)Fset-mouse-position
Move the mouse pointer to the center of character cell (X,Y) in FRAME.
Coordinates are relative to the frame, not a window,
so the coordinates of the top left character in the frame
may be nonzero due to left-hand scroll bars or the menu bar.

This function is a no-op for an X frame that is not visible.
If you have just created a frame, you must wait for it to become visible
before calling this function on it, like this.
  (while (not (frame-visible-p frame)) (sleep-for .5))

(set-mouse-position FRAME X Y)Fset-mouse-pixel-position
Move the mouse pointer to pixel position (X,Y) in FRAME.
Note, this is a no-op for an X frame that is not visible.
If you have just created a frame, you must wait for it to become visible
before calling this function on it, like this.
  (while (not (frame-visible-p frame)) (sleep-for .5))

(set-mouse-pixel-position FRAME X Y)Fmake-frame-visible
Make the frame FRAME visible (assuming it is an X-window).
If omitted, FRAME defaults to the currently selected frame.

(make-frame-visible &optional FRAME)Fmake-frame-invisible
Make the frame FRAME invisible (assuming it is an X-window).
If omitted, FRAME defaults to the currently selected frame.
Normally you may not make FRAME invisible if all other frames are invisible,
but if the second optional argument FORCE is non-nil, you may do so.

(make-frame-invisible &optional FRAME FORCE)Ficonify-frame
Make the frame FRAME into an icon.
If omitted, FRAME defaults to the currently selected frame.

(iconify-frame &optional FRAME)Fframe-visible-p
Return t if FRAME is now "visible" (actually in use for display).
A frame that is not "visible" is not updated and, if it works through
a window system, it may not show at all.
Return the symbol `icon' if frame is visible only as an icon.

(frame-visible-p FRAME)Fvisible-frame-list
Return a list of all frames now "visible" (being updated).

(visible-frame-list)Fraise-frame
Bring FRAME to the front, so it occludes any frames it overlaps.
If FRAME is invisible, make it visible.
If you don't specify a frame, the selected frame is used.
If Emacs is displaying on an ordinary terminal or some other device which
doesn't support multiple overlapping frames, this function does nothing.

(raise-frame &optional FRAME)Flower-frame
Send FRAME to the back, so it is occluded by any frames that overlap it.
If you don't specify a frame, the selected frame is used.
If Emacs is displaying on an ordinary terminal or some other device which
doesn't support multiple overlapping frames, this function does nothing.

(lower-frame &optional FRAME)Fredirect-frame-focus
Arrange for keystrokes typed at FRAME to be sent to FOCUS-FRAME.
In other words, switch-frame events caused by events in FRAME will
request a switch to FOCUS-FRAME, and `last-event-frame' will be
FOCUS-FRAME after reading an event typed at FRAME.

If FOCUS-FRAME is omitted or nil, any existing redirection is
cancelled, and the frame again receives its own keystrokes.

Focus redirection is useful for temporarily redirecting keystrokes to
a surrogate minibuffer frame when a frame doesn't have its own
minibuffer window.

A frame's focus redirection can be changed by select-frame.  If frame
FOO is selected, and then a different frame BAR is selected, any
frames redirecting their focus to FOO are shifted to redirect their
focus to BAR.  This allows focus redirection to work properly when the
user switches from one frame to another using `select-window'.

This means that a frame whose focus is redirected to itself is treated
differently from a frame whose focus is redirected to nil; the former
is affected by select-frame, while the latter is not.

The redirection lasts until `redirect-frame-focus' is called to change it.

(redirect-frame-focus FRAME &optional FOCUS-FRAME)Fframe-focus
Return the frame to which FRAME's keystrokes are currently being sent.
This returns nil if FRAME's focus is not redirected.
See `redirect-frame-focus'.

(frame-focus FRAME)Fframe-parameters
Return the parameters-alist of frame FRAME.
It is a list of elements of the form (PARM . VALUE), where PARM is a symbol.
The meaningful PARMs depend on the kind of frame.
If FRAME is omitted, return information on the currently selected frame.

(frame-parameters &optional FRAME)Fframe-parameter
Return FRAME's value for parameter PARAMETER.
If FRAME is nil, describe the currently selected frame.

(frame-parameter FRAME PARAMETER)Fmodify-frame-parameters
Modify the parameters of frame FRAME according to ALIST.
If FRAME is nil, it defaults to the selected frame.
ALIST is an alist of parameters to change and their new values.
Each element of ALIST has the form (PARM . VALUE), where PARM is a symbol.
The meaningful PARMs depend on the kind of frame.
Undefined PARMs are ignored, but stored in the frame's parameter list
so that `frame-parameters' will return them.

The value of frame parameter FOO can also be accessed
as a frame-local binding for the variable FOO, if you have
enabled such bindings for that variable with `make-variable-frame-local'.

(modify-frame-parameters FRAME ALIST)Fframe-char-height
Height in pixels of a line in the font in frame FRAME.
If FRAME is omitted, the selected frame is used.
For a terminal frame, the value is always 1.

(frame-char-height &optional FRAME)Fframe-char-width
Width in pixels of characters in the font in frame FRAME.
If FRAME is omitted, the selected frame is used.
The width is the same for all characters, because
currently Emacs supports only fixed-width fonts.
For a terminal screen, the value is always 1.

(frame-char-width &optional FRAME)Fframe-pixel-height
Return a FRAME's height in pixels.
This counts only the height available for text lines,
not menu bars on window-system Emacs frames.
For a terminal frame, the result really gives the height in characters.
If FRAME is omitted, the selected frame is used.

(frame-pixel-height &optional FRAME)Fframe-pixel-width
Return FRAME's width in pixels.
For a terminal frame, the result really gives the width in characters.
If FRAME is omitted, the selected frame is used.

(frame-pixel-width &optional FRAME)Fset-frame-height
Specify that the frame FRAME has LINES lines.
Optional third arg non-nil means that redisplay should use LINES lines
but that the idea of the actual height of the frame should not be changed.

(set-frame-height FRAME LINES &optional PRETEND)Fset-frame-width
Specify that the frame FRAME has COLS columns.
Optional third arg non-nil means that redisplay should use COLS columns
but that the idea of the actual width of the frame should not be changed.

(set-frame-width FRAME COLS &optional PRETEND)Fset-frame-size
Sets size of FRAME to COLS by ROWS, measured in characters.

(set-frame-size FRAME COLS ROWS)Fset-frame-position
Sets position of FRAME in pixels to XOFFSET by YOFFSET.
This is actually the position of the upper left corner of the frame.
Negative values for XOFFSET or YOFFSET are interpreted relative to
the rightmost or bottommost possible position (that stays within the screen).

(set-frame-position FRAME XOFFSET YOFFSET)Vdefault-frame-alist
Alist of default values for frame creation.
These may be set in your init file, like this:
  (setq default-frame-alist '((width . 80) (height . 55) (menu-bar-lines . 1))
These override values given in window system configuration data,
 including X Windows' defaults database.
For values specific to the first Emacs frame, see `initial-frame-alist'.
For values specific to the separate minibuffer frame, see
 `minibuffer-frame-alist'.
The `menu-bar-lines' element of the list controls whether new frames
 have menu bars; `menu-bar-mode' works by altering this element.Vterminal-frame
The initial frame-object, which represents Emacs's stdout.Vemacs-iconified
Non-nil if all of emacs is iconified and frame updates are not needed.Vmouse-position-function
If non-nil, function to transform normal value of `mouse-position'.
`mouse-position' calls this function, passing its usual return value as
argument, and returns whatever this function returns.
This abnormal hook exists for the benefit of packages like `xt-mouse.el'
which need to do mouse handling at the Lisp level.Vdefault-minibuffer-frame
Minibufferless frames use this frame's minibuffer.

Emacs cannot create minibufferless frames unless this is set to an
appropriate surrogate.

Emacs consults this variable only when creating minibufferless
frames; once the frame is created, it sticks with its assigned
minibuffer, no matter what this variable is set to.  This means that
this variable doesn't necessarily say anything meaningful about the
current set of frames, or where the minibuffer is currently being
displayed.

This variable is local to the current terminal and cannot be buffer-local.Ftool-bar-lines-needed
Return the number of lines occupied by the tool bar of FRAME.

(tool-bar-lines-needed &optional FRAME)Fdump-glyph-matrix
Dump the current matrix of the selected window to stderr.
Shows contents of glyph row structures.  With non-nil
parameter GLYPHS, dump glyphs as well.  If GLYPHS is 1 show
glyphs in short form, otherwise show glyphs in long form.

(dump-glyph-matrix &optional GLYPHS)Fdump-glyph-row
Dump glyph row ROW to stderr.
GLYPH 0 means don't dump glyphs.
GLYPH 1 means dump glyphs in short form.
GLYPH > 1 or omitted means dump glyphs in long form.

(dump-glyph-row ROW &optional GLYPHS)Fdump-tool-bar-row
Dump glyph row ROW of the tool-bar of the current frame to stderr.
GLYPH 0 means don't dump glyphs.
GLYPH 1 means dump glyphs in short form.
GLYPH > 1 or omitted means dump glyphs in long form.

(dump-tool-bar-row ROW &optional GLYPHS)Ftrace-redisplay
Toggle tracing of redisplay.
With ARG, turn tracing on if and only if ARG is positive.

(trace-redisplay &optional ARG)Ftrace-to-stderr
Like `format', but print result to stderr.Vshow-trailing-whitespace
Non-nil means highlight trailing whitespace.
The face used for trailing whitespace is `trailing-whitespace'.Vinhibit-redisplay
Non-nil means don't actually do any redisplay.
This is used for internal purposes.Vglobal-mode-string
String (or mode line construct) included (normally) in `mode-line-format'.Voverlay-arrow-position
Marker for where to display an arrow on top of the buffer text.
This must be the beginning of a line in order to work.
See also `overlay-arrow-string'.Voverlay-arrow-string
String to display as an arrow.  See also `overlay-arrow-position'.Vscroll-step
*The number of lines to try scrolling a window by when point moves out.
If that fails to bring point back on frame, point is centered instead.
If this is zero, point is always centered after it moves off frame.
If you want scrolling to always be a line at a time, you should set
  `scroll-conservatively' to a large value rather than set this to 1.Vscroll-conservatively
*Scroll up to this many lines, to bring point back on screen.
A value of zero means to scroll the text to center point vertically
in the window.Vscroll-margin
*Number of lines of margin at the top and bottom of a window.
Recenter the window whenever point gets within this many lines
of the top or bottom of the window.Vdebug-end-pos
Don't askVtruncate-partial-width-windows
*Non-nil means truncate lines in all windows less than full frame wide.Vmode-line-inverse-video
nil means display the mode-line/header-line/menu-bar in the default face.
Any other value means to use the appropriate face, `mode-line',
`header-line', or `menu' respectively.

This variable is deprecated; please change the above faces instead.Vline-number-display-limit
*Maximum buffer size for which line number should be displayed.
If the buffer is bigger than this, the line number does not appear
in the mode line.  A value of nil means no limit.Vline-number-display-limit-width
*Maximum line width (in characters) for line number display.
If the average length of the lines near point is bigger than this, then the
line number may be omitted from the mode line.Vhighlight-nonselected-windows
*Non-nil means highlight region even in nonselected windows.Vmultiple-frames
Non-nil if more than one frame is visible on this display.
Minibuffer-only frames don't count, but iconified frames do.
This variable is not guaranteed to be accurate except while processing
`frame-title-format' and `icon-title-format'.Vframe-title-format
Template for displaying the title bar of visible frames.
(Assuming the window manager supports this feature.)
This variable has the same structure as `mode-line-format' (which see),
and is used only on frames for which no explicit name has been set
(see `modify-frame-parameters').Vicon-title-format
Template for displaying the title bar of an iconified frame.
(Assuming the window manager supports this feature.)
This variable has the same structure as `mode-line-format' (which see),
and is used only on frames for which no explicit name has been set
(see `modify-frame-parameters').Vmessage-log-max
Maximum number of lines to keep in the message log buffer.
If nil, disable message logging.  If t, log messages but don't truncate
the buffer when it becomes large.Vwindow-size-change-functions
Functions called before redisplay, if window sizes have changed.
The value should be a list of functions that take one argument.
Just before redisplay, for each frame, if any of its windows have changed
size since the last redisplay, or have been split or deleted,
all the functions in the list are called, with the frame as argument.Vwindow-scroll-functions
List of Functions to call before redisplaying a window with scrolling.
Each function is called with two arguments, the window
and its new display-start position.  Note that the value of `window-end'
is not valid when these functions are called.Vauto-resize-tool-bars
*Non-nil means automatically resize tool-bars.
This increases a tool-bar's height if not all tool-bar items are visible.
It decreases a tool-bar's height when it would display blank lines
otherwise.Vauto-raise-tool-bar-buttons
*Non-nil means raise tool-bar buttons when the mouse moves over them.Vtool-bar-button-margin
*Margin around tool-bar buttons in pixels.
If an integer, use that for both horizontal and vertical margins.
Otherwise, value should be a pair of integers `(HORZ : VERT)' with
HORZ specifying the horizontal margin, and VERT specifying the
vertical margin.Vtool-bar-button-relief
Relief thickness of tool-bar buttons.Vfontification-functions
List of functions to call to fontify regions of text.
Each function is called with one argument POS.  Functions must
fontify a region starting at POS in the current buffer, and give
fontified regions the property `fontified'.
This variable automatically becomes buffer-local when set.Vunibyte-display-via-language-environment
*Non-nil means display unibyte text according to language environment.
Specifically this means that unibyte non-ASCII characters
are displayed by converting them to the equivalent multibyte characters
according to the current language environment.  As a result, they are
displayed according to the current fontset.Vmax-mini-window-height
*Maximum height for resizing mini-windows.
If a float, it specifies a fraction of the mini-window frame's height.
If an integer, it specifies a number of lines.Vresize-mini-windows
*How to resize mini-windows.
A value of nil means don't automatically resize mini-windows.
A value of t means resize them to fit the text displayed in them.
A value of `grow-only', the default, means let mini-windows grow
only, until their display becomes empty, at which point the windows
go back to their normal size.Vcursor-in-non-selected-windows
*Non-nil means display a hollow cursor in non-selected windows.
Nil means don't display a cursor there.Vautomatic-hscrolling
*Non-nil means scroll the display automatically to make point visible.Vimage-types
List of supported image types.
Each element of the list is a symbol for a supported image type.Vmessage-truncate-lines
If non-nil, messages are truncated instead of resizing the echo area.
Bind this around calls to `message' to let it take effect.Vmenu-bar-update-hook
Normal hook run for clicks on menu bar, before displaying a submenu.
Can be used to update submenus whose contents should vary.Vinhibit-menubar-update
Non-nil means don't update menu bars.  Internal use only.Vinhibit-eval-during-redisplay

If the optional argument FRAME is specified, return the minibuffer window
used by that frame.

(minibuffer-window &optional FRAME)Fwindow-minibuffer-p
Returns non-nil if WINDOW is a minibuffer window.

(window-minibuffer-p &optional WINDOW)Fpos-visible-in-window-p
Return t if position POS is currently on the frame in WINDOW.
Return nil if that position is scrolled vertically out of view.
If a character is only partially visible, nil is returned, unless the
optional argument PARTIALLY is non-nil.
POS defaults to point in WINDOW; WINDOW defaults to the selected window.

(pos-visible-in-window-p &optional POS WINDOW PARTIALLY)Fwindow-buffer
Return the buffer that WINDOW is displaying.

(window-buffer &optional WINDOW)Fwindow-height
Return the number of lines in WINDOW (including its mode line).

(window-height &optional WINDOW)Fwindow-width
Return the number of display columns in WINDOW.
This is the width that is usable columns available for text in WINDOW.
If you want to find out how many columns WINDOW takes up,
use  (let ((edges (window-edges))) (- (nth 2 edges) (nth 0 edges))).

(window-width &optional WINDOW)Fwindow-hscroll
Return the number of columns by which WINDOW is scrolled from left margin.

(window-hscroll &optional WINDOW)Fset-window-hscroll
Set number of columns WINDOW is scrolled from left margin to NCOL.
NCOL should be zero or positive.

(set-window-hscroll WINDOW NCOL)Fwindow-redisplay-end-trigger
Return WINDOW's redisplay end trigger value.
See `set-window-redisplay-end-trigger' for more information.

(window-redisplay-end-trigger &optional WINDOW)Fset-window-redisplay-end-trigger
Set WINDOW's redisplay end trigger value to VALUE.
VALUE should be a buffer position (typically a marker) or nil.
If it is a buffer position, then if redisplay in WINDOW reaches a position
beyond VALUE, the functions in `redisplay-end-trigger-functions' are called
with two arguments: WINDOW, and the end trigger value.
Afterwards the end-trigger value is reset to nil.

(set-window-redisplay-end-trigger WINDOW VALUE)Fwindow-edges
Return a list of the edge coordinates of WINDOW.
(LEFT TOP RIGHT BOTTOM), all relative to 0, 0 at top left corner of frame.
RIGHT is one more than the rightmost column used by WINDOW,
and BOTTOM is one more than the bottommost row used by WINDOW
 and its mode-line.

(window-edges &optional WINDOW)Fcoordinates-in-window-p
Return non-nil if COORDINATES are in WINDOW.
COORDINATES is a cons of the form (X . Y), X and Y being distances
measured in characters from the upper-left corner of the frame.
(0 .  0) denotes the character in the upper left corner of the
frame.
If COORDINATES are in the text portion of WINDOW,
   the coordinates relative to the window are returned.
If they are in the mode line of WINDOW, `mode-line' is returned.
If they are in the top mode line of WINDOW, `header-line' is returned.
If they are in the fringe to the left of the window,
   `left-fringe' is returned, if they are in the area on the right of
   the window, `right-fringe' is returned.
If they are on the border between WINDOW and its right sibling,
   `vertical-line' is returned.

(coordinates-in-window-p COORDINATES WINDOW)Fwindow-at
Return window containing coordinates X and Y on FRAME.
If omitted, FRAME defaults to the currently selected frame.
The top left corner of the frame is considered to be row 0,
column 0.

(window-at X Y &optional FRAME)Fwindow-point
Return current value of point in WINDOW.
For a nonselected window, this is the value point would have
if that window were selected.

Note that, when WINDOW is the selected window and its buffer
is also currently selected, the value returned is the same as (point).
It would be more strictly correct to return the `top-level' value
of point, outside of any save-excursion forms.
But that is hard to define.

(window-point &optional WINDOW)Fwindow-start
Return position at which display currently starts in WINDOW.
This is updated by redisplay or by calling `set-window-start'.

(window-start &optional WINDOW)Fwindow-end
Return position at which display currently ends in WINDOW.
This is updated by redisplay, when it runs to completion.
Simply changing the buffer text or setting `window-start'
does not update this value.
If UPDATE is non-nil, compute the up-to-date position
if it isn't already recorded.

(window-end &optional WINDOW UPDATE)Fset-window-point
Make point value in WINDOW be at position POS in WINDOW's buffer.

(set-window-point WINDOW POS)Fset-window-start
Make display in WINDOW start at position POS in WINDOW's buffer.
Optional third arg NOFORCE non-nil inhibits next redisplay
from overriding motion of point in order to display at this exact start.

(set-window-start WINDOW POS &optional NOFORCE)Fwindow-dedicated-p
Return WINDOW's dedicated object, usually t or nil.
See also `set-window-dedicated-p'.

(window-dedicated-p WINDOW)Fset-window-dedicated-p
Control whether WINDOW is dedicated to the buffer it displays.
If it is dedicated, Emacs will not automatically change
which buffer appears in it.
The second argument is the new value for the dedication flag;
non-nil means yes.

(set-window-dedicated-p WINDOW ARG)Fwindow-display-table
Return the display-table that WINDOW is using.

(window-display-table &optional WINDOW)Fset-window-display-table
Set WINDOW's display-table to TABLE.

(set-window-display-table WINDOW TABLE)Fdelete-window
Remove WINDOW from the display.  Default is selected window.

(delete-window &optional WINDOW)Fnext-window
Return next window after WINDOW in canonical ordering of windows.
If omitted, WINDOW defaults to the selected window.

Optional second arg MINIBUF t means count the minibuffer window even
if not active.  MINIBUF nil or omitted means count the minibuffer iff
it is active.  MINIBUF neither t nor nil means not to count the
minibuffer even if it is active.

Several frames may share a single minibuffer; if the minibuffer
counts, all windows on all frames that share that minibuffer count
too.  Therefore, `next-window' can be used to iterate through the
set of windows even when the minibuffer is on another frame.  If the
minibuffer does not count, only windows from WINDOW's frame count.

Optional third arg ALL-FRAMES t means include windows on all frames.
ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means cycle within the frames as specified
above.  ALL-FRAMES = `visible' means include windows on all visible frames.
ALL-FRAMES = 0 means include windows on all visible and iconified frames.
If ALL-FRAMES is a frame, restrict search to windows on that frame.
Anything else means restrict to WINDOW's frame.

If you use consistent values for MINIBUF and ALL-FRAMES, you can use
`next-window' to iterate through the entire cycle of acceptable
windows, eventually ending up back at the window you started with.
`previous-window' traverses the same cycle, in the reverse order.

(next-window &optional WINDOW MINIBUF ALL-FRAMES)Fprevious-window
Return the window preceding WINDOW in canonical ordering of windows.
If omitted, WINDOW defaults to the selected window.

Optional second arg MINIBUF t means count the minibuffer window even
if not active.  MINIBUF nil or omitted means count the minibuffer iff
it is active.  MINIBUF neither t nor nil means not to count the
minibuffer even if it is active.

Several frames may share a single minibuffer; if the minibuffer
counts, all windows on all frames that share that minibuffer count
too.  Therefore, `previous-window' can be used to iterate through
the set of windows even when the minibuffer is on another frame.  If
the minibuffer does not count, only windows from WINDOW's frame count

Optional third arg ALL-FRAMES t means include windows on all frames.
ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means cycle within the frames as specified
above.  ALL-FRAMES = `visible' means include windows on all visible frames.
ALL-FRAMES = 0 means include windows on all visible and iconified frames.
If ALL-FRAMES is a frame, restrict search to windows on that frame.
Anything else means restrict to WINDOW's frame.

If you use consistent values for MINIBUF and ALL-FRAMES, you can use
`previous-window' to iterate through the entire cycle of acceptable
windows, eventually ending up back at the window you started with.
`next-window' traverses the same cycle, in the reverse order.

(previous-window &optional WINDOW MINIBUF ALL-FRAMES)Fother-window
Select the ARG'th different window on this frame.
All windows on current frame are arranged in a cyclic order.
This command selects the window ARG steps away in that order.
A negative ARG moves in the opposite order.  If the optional second
argument ALL_FRAMES is non-nil, cycle through all frames.

(other-window ARG &optional ALL-FRAMES)Fwindow-list
Return a list of windows on FRAME, starting with WINDOW.
FRAME nil or omitted means use the selected frame.
WINDOW nil or omitted means use the selected window.

if it's active.
MINIBUF neither nil nor t means never include the minibuffer window.

(window-list &optional FRAME MINIBUF WINDOW)Fget-lru-window

If FRAME is a frame, search only that frame.

(get-buffer-window BUFFER &optional FRAME)Fdelete-other-windows
Make WINDOW (or the selected window) fill its frame.
Only the frame WINDOW is on is affected.
This function tries to reduce display jumps
by keeping the text previously visible in WINDOW
in the same place on the frame.  Doing this depends on
the value of (window-start WINDOW), so if calling this function
in a program gives strange scrolling, make sure the window-start
value is reasonable when this function is called.

(delete-other-windows &optional WINDOW)Fdelete-windows-on
Delete all windows showing BUFFER.
Optional second argument FRAME controls which frames are affected.
If optional argument FRAME is `visible', search all visible frames.
If FRAME is 0, search all visible and iconified frames.

If FRAME is t, search only the selected frame.
If FRAME is a frame, search only that frame.

(delete-windows-on BUFFER &optional FRAME)Freplace-buffer-in-windows
Replace BUFFER with some other buffer in all windows showing it.

(replace-buffer-in-windows BUFFER)Fset-window-buffer
Make WINDOW display BUFFER as its contents.
BUFFER can be a buffer or buffer name.

(set-window-buffer WINDOW BUFFER)Fselect-window
Select WINDOW.  Most editing will apply to WINDOW's buffer.
If WINDOW is not already selected, also make WINDOW's buffer current.
Note that the main editor command loop
selects the buffer of the selected window before each command.

(select-window WINDOW)Fspecial-display-p
Returns non-nil if a buffer named BUFFER-NAME would be created specially.
The value is actually t if the frame should be called with default frame
parameters, and a list of frame parameters if they were specified.
See `special-display-buffer-names', and `special-display-regexps'.

(special-display-p BUFFER-NAME)Fsame-window-p

See `same-window-buffer-names' and `same-window-regexps'.

(same-window-p BUFFER-NAME)Fdisplay-buffer
Make BUFFER appear in some window but don't select it.
BUFFER can be a buffer or a buffer name.
If BUFFER is shown already in some window, just use that one,
unless the window is the selected window and the optional second
argument NOT-THIS-WINDOW is non-nil (interactively, with prefix arg).
If `pop-up-frames' is non-nil, make a new frame if no window shows BUFFER.
Returns the window displaying BUFFER.
If `display-reuse-frames' is non-nil, and another frame is currently
displaying BUFFER, then simply raise that frame.

The variables `special-display-buffer-names', `special-display-regexps',
`same-window-buffer-names', and `same-window-regexps' customize how certain
buffer names are handled.

If optional argument FRAME is `visible', search all visible frames.
If FRAME is 0, search all visible and iconified frames.
If FRAME is t, search all frames.
If FRAME is a frame, search only that frame.
If FRAME is nil, search only the selected frame
 (actually the last nonminibuffer frame),
 unless `pop-up-frames' or `display-buffer-reuse-frames' is non-nil,
 which means search visible and iconified frames.

If `even-window-heights' is non-nil, window heights will be evened out
if displaying the buffer causes two vertically adjacent windows to be
displayed.

(display-buffer BUFFER &optional NOT-THIS-WINDOW FRAME)Fsplit-window
Split WINDOW, putting SIZE lines in the first of the pair.
WINDOW defaults to selected one and SIZE to half its size.
If optional third arg HORFLAG is non-nil, split side by side
and put SIZE columns in the first of the pair.  In that case,
SIZE includes that window's scroll bar, or the divider column to its right.

(split-window &optional WINDOW SIZE HORFLAG)Fenlarge-window

When calling from a program, supply as argument a number, nil, or `-'.

(scroll-down &optional ARG)Fother-window-for-scrolling
Return the other window for "other window scroll" commands.
If in the minibuffer, `minibuffer-scroll-window' if non-nil
specifies the window.
If `other-window-scroll-buffer' is non-nil, a window
showing that buffer is used.

(other-window-for-scrolling)Fscroll-other-window
Scroll next window upward ARG lines; or near full screen if no ARG.
A near full screen is `next-screen-context-lines' less than a full screen.
The next window is the one below the current one; or the one at the top
if the current one is at the bottom.  Negative ARG means scroll downward.
If ARG is the atom `-', scroll downward by nearly full screen.
When calling from a program, supply as argument a number, nil, or `-'.

If in the minibuffer, `minibuffer-scroll-window' if non-nil
specifies the window to scroll.
If `other-window-scroll-buffer' is non-nil, scroll the window
showing that buffer, popping the buffer up if necessary.

(scroll-other-window &optional ARG)Fscroll-left
Scroll selected window display ARG columns left.
Default for ARG is window width minus 2.
Value is the total amount of leftward horizontal scrolling in
effect after the change.
If `automatic-hscrolling' is non-nil, the argument ARG modifies
a lower bound for automatic scrolling, i.e. automatic scrolling
will not scroll a window to a column less than the value returned
by this function.

(scroll-left &optional ARG)Fscroll-right
Scroll selected window display ARG columns right.
Default for ARG is window width minus 2.
Value is the total amount of leftward horizontal scrolling in
effect after the change.
If `automatic-hscrolling' is non-nil, the argument ARG modifies
a lower bound for automatic scrolling, i.e. automatic scrolling
will not scroll a window to a column less than the value returned
by this function.

(scroll-right &optional ARG)Frecenter
Center point in window and redisplay frame.
With prefix argument ARG, recenter putting point on screen line ARG
relative to the current window.  If ARG is negative, it counts up from the
bottom of the window.  (ARG should be less than the height of the window.)

If ARG is omitted or nil, erase the entire frame and then
redraw with point in the center of the current window.
Just C-u as prefix means put point in the center of the window
and redisplay normally--don't erase and redraw the frame.

(recenter &optional ARG)Fwindow-text-height
Return the height in lines of the text display area of WINDOW.
This doesn't include the mode-line (or header-line if any) or any
partial-height lines in the text display area.

(window-text-height &optional WINDOW)Fmove-to-window-line
Position point relative to window.
With no argument, position point at center of window.
An argument specifies vertical position within the window;
zero means top of window, negative means relative to bottom of window.

(move-to-window-line ARG)Fwindow-configuration-p
Return t if OBJECT is a window-configuration object.

(window-configuration-p OBJECT)Fwindow-configuration-frame
Return the frame that CONFIG, a window-configuration object, is about.

(window-configuration-frame CONFIG)Fset-window-configuration
Set the configuration of windows and buffers as specified by CONFIGURATION.
CONFIGURATION must be a value previously returned
by `current-window-configuration' (which see).
If CONFIGURATION was made from a frame that is now deleted,
only frame-independent values can be restored.  In this case,
the return value is nil.  Otherwise the value is t.

(set-window-configuration CONFIGURATION)Fcurrent-window-configuration
Return an object representing the current window configuration of FRAME.
If FRAME is nil or omitted, use the selected frame.
This describes the number of windows, their sizes and current buffers,
and for each displayed buffer, where display starts, and the positions of
point and mark.  An exception is made for point in the current buffer:
its value is -not- saved.
This also records the currently selected frame, and FRAME's focus
redirection (see `redirect-frame-focus').

(current-window-configuration &optional FRAME)Fsave-window-excursion
Execute body, preserving window sizes and contents.
Restore which buffer appears in which window, where display starts,
and the value of point and mark for each window.
Also restore the choice of selected window.
Also restore which buffer is current.
Does not restore the value of point in current buffer.Fset-window-margins
Set width of marginal areas of window WINDOW.
If window is nil, set margins of the currently selected window.
First parameter LEFT-WIDTH specifies the number of character
cells to reserve for the left marginal area.  Second parameter
RIGHT-WIDTH does the same for the right marginal area.
A nil width parameter means no margin.

(set-window-margins WINDOW LEFT &optional RIGHT)Fwindow-margins
Get width of marginal areas of window WINDOW.
If WINDOW is omitted or nil, use the currently selected window.
Value is a cons of the form (LEFT-WIDTH . RIGHT-WIDTH).
If a marginal area does not exist, its width will be returned
as nil.

(window-margins &optional WINDOW)Fwindow-vscroll

WINDOW nil means use the selected window.  VSCROLL is a non-negative
multiple of the canonical character height of WINDOW.

(set-window-vscroll WINDOW VSCROLL)Fcompare-window-configurations
Compare two window configurations as regards the structure of windows.
This function ignores details such as the values of point and mark
and scrolling positions.

(compare-window-configurations X Y)Vtemp-buffer-show-function
Non-nil means call as function to display a help buffer.
The function is called with one argument, the buffer to be displayed.
Used by `with-output-to-temp-buffer'.
If this function is used, then it must do the entire job of showing
the buffer; `temp-buffer-show-hook' is not run unless this function runs it.Vdisplay-buffer-function
If non-nil, function to call to handle `display-buffer'.
It will receive two args, the buffer and a flag which if non-nil means
 that the currently selected window is not acceptable.
Commands such as `switch-to-buffer-other-window' and `find-file-other-window'
work using this function.Veven-window-heights
*If non-nil, `display-buffer' should even the window heights.
If nil, `display-buffer' will leave the window configuration alone.Vminibuffer-scroll-window
Non-nil means it is the window that C-M-v in minibuffer should scroll.Vother-window-scroll-buffer
If non-nil, this is a buffer and \[scroll-other-window] should scroll its window.Vpop-up-frames
*Non-nil means `display-buffer' should make a separate frame.Vdisplay-buffer-reuse-frames
*Non-nil means `display-buffer' should reuse frames.
If the buffer in question is already displayed in a frame, raise that frame.Vpop-up-frame-function
Function to call to handle automatic new frame creation.
It is called with no arguments and should return a newly created frame.

A typical value might be `(lambda () (new-frame pop-up-frame-alist))'
where `pop-up-frame-alist' would hold the default frame parameters.Vspecial-display-buffer-names
*List of buffer names that should have their own special frames.
Displaying a buffer whose name is in this list makes a special frame for it
using `special-display-function'.  See also `special-display-regexps'.

An element of the list can be a list instead of just a string.
There are two ways to use a list as an element:
  (BUFFER FRAME-PARAMETERS...)   (BUFFER FUNCTION OTHER-ARGS...)
In the first case, FRAME-PARAMETERS are used to create the frame.
In the latter case, FUNCTION is called with BUFFER as the first argument,
followed by OTHER-ARGS--it can display BUFFER in any way it likes.
All this is done by the function found in `special-display-function'.

If this variable appears "not to work", because you add a name to it
but that buffer still appears in the selected window, look at the
values of `same-window-buffer-names' and `same-window-regexps'.
Those variables take precedence over this one.Vspecial-display-regexps
*List of regexps saying which buffers should have their own special frames.
If a buffer name matches one of these regexps, it gets its own frame.
Displaying a buffer whose name is in this list makes a special frame for it
using `special-display-function'.

An element of the list can be a list instead of just a string.
There are two ways to use a list as an element:
  (REGEXP FRAME-PARAMETERS...)   (REGEXP FUNCTION OTHER-ARGS...)
In the first case, FRAME-PARAMETERS are used to create the frame.
In the latter case, FUNCTION is called with the buffer as first argument,
followed by OTHER-ARGS--it can display the buffer in any way it likes.
All this is done by the function found in `special-display-function'.

If this variable appears "not to work", because you add a regexp to it
but the matching buffers still appear in the selected window, look at the
values of `same-window-buffer-names' and `same-window-regexps'.
Those variables take precedence over this one.Vspecial-display-function
Function to call to make a new frame for a special buffer.
It is called with two arguments, the buffer and optional buffer specific
data, and should return a window displaying that buffer.
The default value makes a separate frame for the buffer,
using `special-display-frame-alist' to specify the frame parameters.

A buffer is special if its is listed in `special-display-buffer-names'
or matches a regexp in `special-display-regexps'.Vsame-window-buffer-names
*List of buffer names that should appear in the selected window.
Displaying one of these buffers using `display-buffer' or `pop-to-buffer'
switches to it in the selected window, rather than making it appear
in some other window.

An element of the list can be a cons cell instead of just a string.
Then the car must be a string, which specifies the buffer name.
This is for compatibility with `special-display-buffer-names';
the cdr of the cons cell is ignored.

See also `same-window-regexps'.Vsame-window-regexps
*List of regexps saying which buffers should appear in the selected window.
If a buffer name matches one of these regexps, then displaying it
using `display-buffer' or `pop-to-buffer' switches to it
in the selected window, rather than making it appear in some other window.

An element of the list can be a cons cell instead of just a string.
Then the car must be a string, which specifies the buffer name.
This is for compatibility with `special-display-buffer-names';
the cdr of the cons cell is ignored.

See also `same-window-buffer-names'.Vpop-up-windows
*Non-nil means display-buffer should make new windows.Vnext-screen-context-lines
*Number of lines of continuity when scrolling by screenfuls.Vsplit-height-threshold
*display-buffer would prefer to split the largest window if this large.
If there is only one window, it is split regardless of this value.Vwindow-min-height
*Delete any window less than this tall (including its mode line).Vwindow-min-width
*Delete any window less than this wide.Vscroll-preserve-screen-position
*Non-nil means scroll commands move point to keep its screen line unchanged.Vwindow-configuration-change-hook
Functions to call when window configuration changes.
The selected frame is the one whose configuration has changed.Vwindow-size-fixed
Non-nil in a buffer means windows displaying the buffer are fixed-size.
Emacs won't change the size of any window displaying that buffer,
unless you explicitly change the size, or Emacs has no other choice.
This variable automatically becomes buffer-local when set.Fdefine-charset
Define CHARSET-ID as the identification number of CHARSET with INFO-VECTOR.
If CHARSET-ID is nil, it is decided automatically, which means CHARSET is
 treated as a private charset.
INFO-VECTOR is a vector of the format:
   [DIMENSION CHARS WIDTH DIRECTION ISO-FINAL-CHAR ISO-GRAPHIC-PLANE
    SHORT-NAME LONG-NAME DESCRIPTION]
The meanings of each elements is as follows:
DIMENSION (integer) is the number of bytes to represent a character: 1 or 2.
CHARS (integer) is the number of characters in a dimension: 94 or 96.
WIDTH (integer) is the number of columns a character in the charset
occupies on the screen: one of 0, 1, and 2.

DIRECTION (integer) is the rendering direction of characters in the
charset when rendering.  If 0, render from left to right, else
render from right to left.

ISO-FINAL-CHAR (character) is the final character of the
corresponding ISO 2022 charset.
It may be -1 if the charset is internal use only.

ISO-GRAPHIC-PLANE (integer) is the graphic plane to be invoked
while encoding to variants of ISO 2022 coding system, one of the
following: 0/graphic-plane-left(GL), 1/graphic-plane-right(GR).
It may be -1 if the charset is internal use only.

SHORT-NAME (string) is the short name to refer to the charset.

LONG-NAME (string) is the long name to refer to the charset.

DESCRIPTION (string) is the description string of the charset.

Return an unsed ISO's final char for a charset of DIMENISION and CHARS.
DIMENSION is the number of bytes to represent a character: 1 or 2.
CHARS is the number of characters in a dimension: 94 or 96.

This final char is for private use, thus the range is `0' (48) .. `?' (63).
If there's no unused final char for the specified kind of charset,
return nil.

(get-unused-iso-final-char DIMENSION CHARS)Fdeclare-equiv-charset
Declare a charset of DIMENSION, CHARS, FINAL-CHAR is the same as CHARSET.
CHARSET should be defined by `defined-charset' in advance.

(declare-equiv-charset DIMENSION CHARS FINAL-CHAR CHARSET-SYMBOL)Ffind-charset-region
Return a list of charsets in the region between BEG and END.
BEG and END are buffer positions.
Optional arg TABLE if non-nil is a translation table to look up.

`unknown' is included in the returned list.

If the current buffer is unibyte, the returned list may contain
only `ascii', `eight-bit-control', and `eight-bit-graphic'.

(find-charset-region BEG END &optional TABLE)Ffind-charset-string
Return a list of charsets in STR.
Optional arg TABLE if non-nil is a translation table to look up.

If the string contains invalid multibyte characters,
`unknown' is included in the returned list.

If STR is unibyte, the returned list may contain
only `ascii', `eight-bit-control', and `eight-bit-graphic'.

(find-charset-string STR &optional TABLE)Fmake-char-internal


(make-char-internal CHARSET &optional CODE1 CODE2)Fsplit-char
Return list of charset and one or two position-codes of CHAR.
If CHAR is invalid as a character code,
return a list of symbol `unknown' and CHAR.

(split-char CH)Fchar-charset
Return charset of CHAR.

(char-charset CH)Fcharset-after
Return charset of a character in the current buffer at position POS.
If POS is nil, it defauls to the current point.
If POS is out of range, the value is nil.

(charset-after &optional POS)Fiso-charset
Return charset of ISO's specification DIMENSION, CHARS, and FINAL-CHAR.

ISO 2022's designation sequence (escape sequence) distinguishes charsets
by their DIMENSION, CHARS, and FINAL-CHAR,
where as Emacs distinguishes them by charset symbol.
See the documentation of the function `charset-info' for the meanings of
DIMENSION, CHARS, and FINAL-CHAR.

(iso-charset DIMENSION CHARS FINAL-CHAR)Fchar-valid-p
Return t if OBJECT is a valid normal character.
If optional arg GENERICP is non-nil, also return t if OBJECT is
a valid generic character.

(char-valid-p OBJECT &optional GENERICP)Funibyte-char-to-multibyte
Convert the unibyte character CH to multibyte character.
The conversion is done based on `nonascii-translation-table' (which see)
 or `nonascii-insert-offset' (which see).

(unibyte-char-to-multibyte CH)Fmultibyte-char-to-unibyte
Convert the multibyte character CH to unibyte character.
The conversion is done based on `nonascii-translation-table' (which see)
 or `nonascii-insert-offset' (which see).

(multibyte-char-to-unibyte CH)Fchar-bytes
Return 1 regardless of the argument CHAR.
This is now an obsolete function.  We keep it just for backward compatibility.

(char-bytes CH)Fchar-width
Return width of CHAR when displayed in the current buffer.
The width is measured by how many columns it occupies on the screen.
Tab is taken to occupy `tab-width' columns.

(char-width CH)Fstring-width
Return width of STRING when displayed in the current buffer.
Width is measured by how many columns it occupies on the screen.
When calculating width of a multibyte character in STRING,
only the base leading-code is considered; the validity of
the following bytes is not checked.  Tabs in STRING are always
taken to occupy `tab-width' columns.

(keyboard-coding-system)Ffind-operation-coding-system
Choose a coding system for an operation based on the target name.
The value names a pair of coding systems: (DECODING-SYSTEM . ENCODING-SYSTEM).
DECODING-SYSTEM is the coding system to use for decoding
(in case OPERATION does decoding), and ENCODING-SYSTEM is the coding system
for encoding (in case OPERATION does encoding).

The first argument OPERATION specifies an I/O primitive:
  For file I/O, `insert-file-contents' or `write-region'.
  For process I/O, `call-process', `call-process-region', or `start-process'.
  For network I/O, `open-network-stream'.

The remaining arguments should be the same arguments that were passed
to the primitive.  Depending on which primitive, one of those arguments
is selected as the TARGET.  For example, if OPERATION does file I/O,
whichever argument specifies the file name is TARGET.

TARGET has a meaning which depends on OPERATION:
  For file I/O, TARGET is a file name.
  For process I/O, TARGET is a process name.
  For network I/O, TARGET is a service name or a port number

This function looks up what specified for TARGET in,
`file-coding-system-alist', `process-coding-system-alist',
or `network-coding-system-alist' depending on OPERATION.
They may specify a coding system, a cons of coding systems,
or a function symbol to call.

associated with each coding-category one by one in this order.  When
one algorithm agrees with a byte sequence of source text, the coding
system bound to the corresponding coding-category is selected.Vcoding-system-for-read
Specify the coding system for read operations.
It is useful to bind this variable with `let', but do not set it globally.
If the value is a coding system, it is used for decoding on read operation.

There are three such tables, `file-coding-system-alist',
`process-coding-system-alist', and `network-coding-system-alist'.Vcoding-system-for-write
Specify the coding system for write operations.
Programs bind this variable with `let', but you should not set it globally.
If the value is a coding system, it is used for encoding of output,
when writing it to a file and when sending it to a file or subprocess.

If this does not specify a coding system, an appropriate element
is used from one of the coding system alists:
There are three such tables, `file-coding-system-alist',
`process-coding-system-alist', and `network-coding-system-alist'.
For output to files, if the above procedure does not specify a coding system,
the value of `buffer-file-coding-system' is used.Vlast-coding-system-used

The format is ((PATTERN . VAL) ...),
where PATTERN is a regular expression matching a file name,
VAL is a coding system, a cons of coding systems, or a function symbol.
If VAL is a coding system, it is used for both decoding and encoding
the file contents.
If VAL is a cons of coding systems, the car part is used for decoding,
and the cdr part is used for encoding.
If VAL is a function symbol, the function must return a coding system
or a cons of coding systems which are used as above.

from the program and encoding what sent to the program.
If VAL is a cons of coding systems, the car part is used for decoding,
and the cdr part is used for encoding.
If VAL is a function symbol, the function must return a coding system
or a cons of coding systems which are used as above.

See also the function `find-operation-coding-system'.Vnetwork-coding-system-alist

The car part is used for decoding a process output,
the cdr part is used for encoding a text to be sent to a process.Vlatin-extra-code-table
Table of extra Latin codes in the range 128..159 (inclusive).
This is a vector of length 256.
If Nth element is non-nil, the existence of code N in a file
(or output of subprocess) doesn't prevent it to be detected as
a coding system of ISO 2022 variant which has a flag
`accept-latin-extra-code' t (e.g. iso-latin-1) on reading a file
or reading output of a subprocess.
Only 128th through 159th elements has a meaning.Vselect-safe-coding-system-function
Function to call to select safe coding system for encoding a text.

If set, this function is called to force a user to select a proper
coding system which can encode the text in the case that a default
coding system used in each operation can't encode the text.

The default value is `select-safe-coding-system' (which see).Vchar-coding-system-table
Char-table containing safe coding systems of each characters.
Each element doesn't include such generic coding systems that can
encode any characters.   They are in the first extra slot.Vinhibit-iso-escape-detection
If non-nil, Emacs ignores ISO2022's escape sequence on code detection.

By default, on reading a file, Emacs tries to detect how the text is
encoded.  This code detection is sensitive to escape sequences.  If
the sequence is valid as ISO2022, the code is determined as one of
the ISO2022 encodings, and the file is decoded by the corresponding
coding system (e.g. `iso-2022-7bit').

However, there may be a case that you want to read escape sequences in
a file as is.  In such a case, you can set this variable to non-nil.
Then, as the code detection ignores any escape sequences, no file is
detected as encoded in some ISO2022 encoding.  The result is that all
escape sequences become visible in a buffer.

The default value is nil, and it is strongly recommended not to change
it.  That is because many Emacs Lisp source files that contain
non-ASCII characters are encoded by the coding system `iso-2022-7bit'
in Emacs's distribution, and they won't be decoded correctly on
reading if you suppress escape sequence detection.

The other way to read escape sequences in a file without decoding is
to explicitly specify some coding system that doesn't use ISO2022's
escape sequence (e.g `latin-1') on reading by \[universal-coding-system-argument].Fmake-category-set
Return a newly created category-set which contains CATEGORIES.
CATEGORIES is a string of category mnemonics.
The value is a bool-vector which has t at the indices corresponding to
those categories.

(modify-category-entry CHARACTER CATEGORY &optional TABLE RESET)Fdescribe-categories
Describe the category specifications in the current category table.
The descriptions are inserted in a buffer, which is then displayed.

(describe-categories)Vword-combining-categories
List of pair (cons) of categories to determine word boundary.

Emacs treats a sequence of word constituent characters as a single
word (i.e. finds no word boundary between them) iff they belongs to
the same charset.  But, exceptions are allowed in the following cases.

(1) The case that characters are in different charsets is controlled
by the variable `word-combining-categories'.

Emacs finds no word boundary between characters of different charsets
if they have categories matching some element of this list.

More precisely, if an element of this list is a cons of category CAT1
and CAT2, and a multibyte character C1 which has CAT1 is followed by
C2 which has CAT2, there's no word boundary between C1 and C2.

For instance, to tell that ASCII characters and Latin-1 characters can
form a single word, the element `(?l . ?l)' should be in this list
because both characters have the category `l' (Latin characters).

(2) The case that character are in the same charset is controlled by
the variable `word-separating-categories'.

Emacs find a word boundary between characters of the same charset
if they have categories matching some element of this list.

More precisely, if an element of this list is a cons of category CAT1
and CAT2, and a multibyte character C1 which has CAT1 is followed by
C2 which has CAT2, there's a word boundary between C1 and C2.

For instance, to tell that there's a word boundary between Japanese
Hiragana and Japanese Kanji (both are in the same charset), the
element `(?H . ?C) should be in this list.Vword-separating-categories
List of pair (cons) of categories to determine word boundary.
See the documentation of the variable `word-combining-categories'.Fccl-program-p

CCL-PROGRAM is a CCL program name (symbol)
or compiled code generated by `ccl-compile' (for backward compatibility.
In the latter case, the execution overhead is bigger than in the former).
No I/O commands should appear in CCL-PROGRAM.

REGISTERS is a vector of [R0 R1 ... R7] where RN is an initial value
for the Nth register.

As side effect, each element of REGISTERS holds the value of
the corresponding register after the execution.

See the documentation of `define-ccl-program' for a definition of CCL
programs.

(ccl-execute CCL-PROG REG)Fccl-execute-on-string
Execute CCL-PROGRAM with initial STATUS on STRING.

CCL-PROGRAM is a symbol registered by register-ccl-program,
or a compiled code generated by `ccl-compile' (for backward compatibility,
in this case, the execution is slower).

Read buffer is set to STRING, and write buffer is allocated automatically.

STATUS is a vector of [R0 R1 ... R7 IC], where
 R0..R7 are initial values of corresponding registers,
 IC is the instruction counter specifying from where to start the program.
If R0..R7 are nil, they are initialized to 0.
If IC is nil, it is initialized to head of the CCL program.

If optional 4th arg CONTINUE is non-nil, keep IC on read operation
when read buffer is exausted, else, IC is always set to the end of
CCL-PROGRAM on exit.

It returns the contents of write buffer as a string,
 and as side effect, STATUS is updated.
If the optional 5th arg UNIBYTE-P is non-nil, the returned string
is a unibyte string.  By default it is a multibyte string.

See the documentation of `define-ccl-program' for the detail of CCL program.

 CCL-CODE is executed to calculate the code point in the font
 from the charset number and position code(s) of the character which are set
 in CCL registers R0, R1, and R2 before the execution.
The code point in the font is set in CCL registers R1 and R2
 when the execution terminated.
If the font is single-byte font, the register R2 is not used.Ftty-display-color-p

the pixmap.  Bits are stored row by row, each row occupies
(WIDTH + 7)/8 bytes.

(bitmap-spec-p OBJECT)Fcolor-gray-p
Return non-nil if COLOR is a shade of gray (or white or black).

the same size as FACE on FRAME.
PATTERN is a string, perhaps with wildcard characters;
  the * character matches any substring, and
  the ? character matches any single character.
  PATTERN is case-insensitive.
FACE is a face name--a symbol.

The return value is a list of strings, suitable as arguments to
set-face-font.

Default face attributes override any local face attributes.

(internal-merge-in-global-face FACE FRAME)Fface-font
Return the font name of face FACE, or nil if it is unspecified.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
  The font default for a face is either nil, or a list
  of the form (bold), (italic) or (bold italic).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.

(face-font FACE &optional FRAME)Finternal-lisp-face-equal-p
True if FACE1 and FACE2 are equal.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.

(internal-lisp-face-equal-p FACE1 FACE2 &optional FRAME)Finternal-lisp-face-empty-p
True if FACE has no attribute specified.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.

(internal-lisp-face-empty-p FACE &optional FRAME)Fframe-face-alist
Return an alist of frame-local faces defined on FRAME.
For internal use only.

(frame-face-alist &optional FRAME)Finternal-set-font-selection-order
Set font selection order for face font selection to ORDER.
ORDER must be a list of length 4 containing the symbols `:width',
`:height', `:weight', and `:slant'.  Face attributes appearing
first in ORDER are matched first, e.g. if `:height' appears before
`:weight' in ORDER, font selection first tries to find a font with
a suitable height, and then tries to match the font weight.
Value is ORDER.

(internal-set-font-selection-order ORDER)Finternal-set-alternative-font-family-alist
Define alternative font families to try in face font selection.
ALIST is an alist of (FAMILY ALTERNATIVE1 ALTERNATIVE2 ...) entries.
Each ALTERNATIVE is tried in order if no fonts of font family FAMILY can
be found.  Value is ALIST.

(internal-set-alternative-font-family-alist ALIST)Finternal-set-alternative-font-registry-alist
Define alternative font registries to try in face font selection.
ALIST is an alist of (REGISTRY ALTERNATIVE1 ALTERNATIVE2 ...) entries.
Each ALTERNATIVE is tried in order if no fonts of font registry REGISTRY can
be found.  Value is ALIST.

(internal-set-alternative-font-registry-alist ALIST)Ftty-suppress-bold-inverse-default-colors
Suppress/allow boldness of faces with inverse default colors.
SUPPRESS non-nil means suppress it.
This affects bold faces on TTYs whose foreground is the default background
color of the display and whose background is the default foreground color.
For such faces, the bold face attribute is ignored if this variable
is non-nil.

(tty-suppress-bold-inverse-default-colors SUPPRESS)Fdump-face


(dump-face &optional N)Fshow-face-resources


(show-face-resources)Vfont-list-limit
*Limit for font matching.
If an integer > 0, font matching functions won't load more than
that number of fonts when searching for a matching font.Vface-new-frame-defaults
List of global face definitions (for internal use only.)Vface-default-stipple
*Default stipple pattern used on monochrome displays.
This stipple pattern is used on monochrome displays
instead of shades of gray for a face background color.
See `set-face-stipple' for possible values for this variable.Vtty-defined-color-alist
An alist of defined terminal colors and their RGB values.Vscalable-fonts-allowed
Allowed scalable fonts.
A value of nil means don't allow any scalable fonts.
A value of t means allow any scalable font.
Otherwise, value must be a list of regular expressions.  A font may be
scaled if its name matches a regular expression in the list.
Note that if value is nil, a scalable font might still be used, if no
other font of the appropriate family and registry is available.Vface-ignored-fonts
List of ignored fonts.
Each element is a regular expression that matches names of fonts to ignore.Finvocation-name
Return the program name that was used to run Emacs.
Any directory names are omitted.

(invocation-name)Finvocation-directory
Return the directory name in which the Emacs executable was located.

(invocation-directory)Fkill-emacs
Exit the Emacs job and kill it.
If ARG is an integer, return ARG as the exit program code.
If ARG is a  string, stuff it as keyboard input.

The value of `kill-emacs-hook', if not void,
is a list of functions (of no args),
all of which are called before Emacs is actually killed.

(kill-emacs &optional ARG)Fdump-emacs-data
Dump current state of Emacs into data file FILENAME.
This function exists on systems that use HAVE_SHM.

(dump-emacs-data FILENAME)Fdump-emacs
Dump current state of Emacs into executable file FILENAME.
Take symbols from SYMFILE (presumably the file you executed to run Emacs).
This is used in the file `loadup.el' when building Emacs.

You must run Emacs in batch mode in order to dump it.

(dump-emacs FILENAME SYMFILE)Vcommand-line-args
Args passed by shell to Emacs, as a list of strings.Vsystem-type
Value is symbol indicating type of operating system you are using.Vsystem-configuration
Value is string indicating configuration Emacs was built for.
On MS-Windows, the value reflects the OS flavor and version on which
Emacs is running.Vsystem-configuration-options
String containing the configuration options Emacs was built with.Vnoninteractive
Non-nil means Emacs is running without interactive terminal.Vkill-emacs-hook
Hook to be run whenever kill-emacs is called.
Since kill-emacs may be invoked when the terminal is disconnected (or
in other similar situations), functions placed on this hook should not
expect to be able to interact with the user.  To ask for confirmation,
see `kill-emacs-query-functions' instead.Vsignal-USR1-hook
Hook to be run whenever emacs receives a USR1 signalVsignal-USR2-hook
Hook to be run whenever emacs receives a USR2 signalVemacs-priority
Priority for Emacs to run at.
This value is effective only if set before Emacs is dumped,
and only if the Emacs executable is installed with setuid to permit
it to change priority.  (Emacs sets its uid back to the real uid.)
Currently, you need to define SET_EMACS_PRIORITY in `config.h'
before you compile Emacs, to enable the code for this feature.Vpath-separator
The directory separator in search paths, as a string.Vinvocation-name
The program name that was used to run Emacs.
Any directory names are omitted.Vinvocation-directory
The directory in which the Emacs executable was found, to run it.
The value is nil if that directory's name is not known.Vinstallation-directory
A directory within which to look for the `lib-src' and `etc' directories.
This is non-nil when we can't find those directories in their standard
installed locations, but we can find them
near where the Emacs executable was found.Vsystem-messages-locale
System locale for messages.Vprevious-system-messages-locale
Most recently used system locale for messages.Vsystem-time-locale
System locale for time.Vprevious-system-time-locale
Most recently used system locale for time.Frecursive-edit
Invoke the editor command loop recursively.
To get out of the recursive edit, a command can do `(throw 'exit nil)';
that tells this function to return.
Alternately, `(throw 'exit t)' makes this function signal an error.
This function is called by the editor initialization to begin editing.

(recursive-edit)Ftop-level
Exit all recursive editing levels.

(top-level)Fexit-recursive-edit
Exit from the innermost recursive edit or minibuffer.

(exit-recursive-edit)Fabort-recursive-edit
Abort the command that requested this recursive edit or minibuffer input.

(abort-recursive-edit)Ftrack-mouse
Evaluate BODY with mouse movement events enabled.
Within a `track-mouse' form, mouse motion generates input events that
you can read with `read-event'.
Normally, mouse motion is ignored.Fevent-convert-list
Convert the event description list EVENT-DESC to an event type.
EVENT-DESC should contain one base event type (a character or symbol)
and zero or more modifier names (control, meta, hyper, super, shift, alt,
drag, down, double or triple).  The base must be last.
The return value is an event type (a character or symbol) which
has the same base event type and all the specified modifiers.

(event-convert-list EVENT-DESC)Fread-key-sequence
Read a sequence of keystrokes and return as a string or vector.
The sequence is sufficient to specify a non-prefix command in the
current local and global maps.

First arg PROMPT is a prompt string.  If nil, do not prompt specially.
Second (optional) arg CONTINUE-ECHO, if non-nil, means this key echos
as a continuation of the previous key.

The third (optional) arg DONT-DOWNCASE-LAST, if non-nil, means do not
convert the last event to lower case.  (Normally any upper case event
is converted to lower case if the original event is undefined and the lower
case equivalent is defined.)  A non-nil value is appropriate for reading
a key sequence to be defined.

A C-g typed while in this function is treated like any other character,
and `quit-flag' is not set.

If the key sequence starts with a mouse click, then the sequence is read
using the keymaps of the buffer of the window clicked in, not the buffer
of the selected window as normal.

`read-key-sequence' drops unbound button-down events, since you normally
only care about the click or drag events which follow them.  If a drag
or multi-click event is unbound, but the corresponding click event would
be bound, `read-key-sequence' turns the event into a click event at the
drag's starting position.  This means that you don't have to distinguish
between click and drag, double, or triple events unless you want to.

`read-key-sequence' prefixes mouse events on mode lines, the vertical
lines separating windows, and scroll bars with imaginary keys
`mode-line', `vertical-line', and `vertical-scroll-bar'.

Optional fourth argument CAN-RETURN-SWITCH-FRAME non-nil means that this
function will process a switch-frame event if the user switches frames
before typing anything.  If the user switches frames in the middle of a
key sequence, or at the start of the sequence but CAN-RETURN-SWITCH-FRAME
is nil, then the event will be put off until after the current key sequence.

`read-key-sequence' checks `function-key-map' for function key
sequences, where they wouldn't conflict with ordinary bindings.  See
`function-key-map' for more details.

The optional fifth argument COMMAND-LOOP, if non-nil, means
that this key sequence is being read by something that will
read commands one after another.  It should be nil if the caller
will read just one key sequence.

(read-key-sequence PROMPT &optional CONTINUE-ECHO DONT-DOWNCASE-LAST CAN-RETURN-SWITCH-FRAME COMMAND-LOOP)Fread-key-sequence-vector
Like `read-key-sequence' but always return a vector.

(read-key-sequence-vector PROMPT &optional CONTINUE-ECHO DONT-DOWNCASE-LAST CAN-RETURN-SWITCH-FRAME COMMAND-LOOP)Fcommand-execute
Execute CMD as an editor command.
CMD must be a symbol that satisfies the `commandp' predicate.
Optional second arg RECORD-FLAG non-nil
means unconditionally put this command in `command-history'.
Otherwise, that is done only if an arg is read using the minibuffer.
The argument KEYS specifies the value to use instead of (this-command-keys)
when reading the arguments; if it is nil, (this-command-keys) is used.
The argument SPECIAL, if non-nil, means that this command is executing
a special event, so ignore the prefix argument and don't clear it.

(command-execute CMD &optional RECORD-FLAG KEYS SPECIAL)Fexecute-extended-command
Read function name, then read its arguments and call it.

(execute-extended-command PREFIXARG)Finput-pending-p
T if command input is currently available with no waiting.
Actually, the value is nil only if we can be sure that no input is available.

(input-pending-p)Frecent-keys
Return vector of last 100 events, not counting those from keyboard macros.

(recent-keys)Fthis-command-keys
Return the key sequence that invoked this command.
The value is a string or a vector.

(this-command-keys)Fthis-command-keys-vector
Return the key sequence that invoked this command, as a vector.

(this-command-keys-vector)Fthis-single-command-keys
Return the key sequence that invoked this command.
Unlike `this-command-keys', this function's value
does not include prefix arguments.
The value is always a vector.

(this-single-command-keys)Fthis-single-command-raw-keys
Return the raw events that were read for this command.
Unlike `this-single-command-keys', this function's value
shows the events before all translations (except for input methods).
The value is always a vector.

(this-single-command-raw-keys)Freset-this-command-lengths
Used for complicated reasons in `universal-argument-other-key'.

`universal-argument-other-key' rereads the event just typed.
It then gets translated through `function-key-map'.
The translated event gets included in the echo area and in
the value of `this-command-keys' in addition to the raw original event.
That is not right.

Calling this function directs the translated event to replace
the original event, so that only one version of the event actually
appears in the echo area and in the value of `this-command-keys'.

(reset-this-command-lengths)Fclear-this-command-keys
Clear out the vector that `this-command-keys' returns.
Clear vector containing last 100 events.

(clear-this-command-keys)Frecursion-depth
Return the current depth in recursive edits.

(recursion-depth)Fopen-dribble-file
Start writing all keyboard characters to a dribble file called FILE.
If FILE is nil, close any open dribble file.

(open-dribble-file FILE)Fdiscard-input
Discard the contents of the terminal input buffer.
Also cancel any kbd macro being defined.

(discard-input)Fsuspend-emacs
Stop Emacs and return to superior process.  You can resume later.
If `cannot-suspend' is non-nil, or if the system doesn't support job
control, run a subshell instead.

If optional arg STUFFSTRING is non-nil, its characters are stuffed
to be read as terminal input by Emacs's parent, after suspension.

Before suspending, run the normal hook `suspend-hook'.
After resumption run the normal hook `suspend-resume-hook'.

Some operating systems cannot stop the Emacs process and resume it later.
On such systems, Emacs starts a subshell instead of suspending.

(suspend-emacs &optional STUFFSTRING)Fset-input-mode
Set mode of reading keyboard input.
First arg INTERRUPT non-nil means use input interrupts;
 nil means use CBREAK mode.
Second arg FLOW non-nil means use ^S/^Q flow control for output to terminal
 (no effect except in CBREAK mode).
Third arg META t means accept 8-bit input (for a Meta key).
 META nil means ignore the top bit, on the assumption it is parity.
 Otherwise, accept 8-bit input and don't use the top bit for Meta.
Optional fourth arg QUIT if non-nil specifies character to use for quitting.
See also `current-input-mode'.

(set-input-mode INTERRUPT FLOW META &optional QUIT)Fcurrent-input-mode
Return information about the way Emacs currently reads keyboard input.
The value is a list of the form (INTERRUPT FLOW META QUIT), where
  INTERRUPT is non-nil if Emacs is using interrupt-driven input; if
    nil, Emacs is using CBREAK mode.
  FLOW is non-nil if Emacs uses ^S/^Q flow control for output to the
    terminal; this does not apply if Emacs uses interrupt-driven input.
  META is t if accepting 8-bit input with 8th bit as Meta flag.
    META nil means ignoring the top bit, on the assumption it is parity.
    META is neither t nor nil if accepting 8-bit input and using
    all 8 bits as the character code.
  QUIT is the character Emacs currently uses to quit.
The elements of this list correspond to the arguments of
`set-input-mode'.

(current-input-mode)Vlast-command-char
Last input event that was part of a command.Vlast-command-event
Last input event that was part of a command.Vlast-nonmenu-event
Last input event in a command, except for mouse menu events.
Mouse menus give back keys that don't look like mouse events;
this variable holds the actual mouse event that led to the menu,
so that you can determine whether the command was run by mouse or not.Vlast-input-char
Last input event.Vlast-input-event
Last input event.Vunread-command-events
List of events to be read as the command input.
These events are processed first, before actual keyboard input.Vunread-command-char
If not -1, an object to be read as next command input event.Vunread-post-input-method-events
List of events to be processed as input by input methods.
These events are processed after `unread-command-events', but
before actual keyboard input.Vunread-input-method-events
List of events to be processed as input by input methods.
These events are processed after `unread-command-events', but
before actual keyboard input.Vmeta-prefix-char
Meta-prefix character code.
Meta-foo as command input turns into this character followed by foo.Vlast-command
The last command executed.
Normally a symbol with a function definition, but can be whatever was found
in the keymap, or whatever the variable `this-command' was set to by that
command.

The value `mode-exit' is special; it means that the previous command
read an event that told it to exit, and it did so and unread that event.
In other words, the present command is the event that made the previous
command exit.

The value `kill-region' is special; it means that the previous command
was a kill command.Vreal-last-command
Same as `last-command', but never altered by Lisp code.Vthis-command
The command now being executed.
The command can set this variable; whatever is put here
will be in `last-command' during the following command.Vauto-save-interval
*Number of input events between auto-saves.
Zero means disable autosaving due to number of characters typed.Vauto-save-timeout
*Number of seconds idle time before auto-save.
Zero or nil means disable auto-saving due to idleness.
After auto-saving due to this many seconds of idle time,
Emacs also does a garbage collection if that seems to be warranted.Vecho-keystrokes
*Nonzero means echo unfinished commands after this many seconds of pause.
The value may be integer or floating point.Vpolling-period
*Interval between polling for input during Lisp execution.
The reason for polling is to make C-g work to stop a running program.
Polling is needed only when using X windows and SIGIO does not work.
Polling is automatically disabled in all other cases.Vdouble-click-time
*Maximum time between mouse clicks to make a double-click.
Measured in milliseconds.  nil means disable double-click recognition;
t means double-clicks have no time limit and are detected
by position only.Vdouble-click-fuzz
*Maximum mouse movement between clicks to make a double-click.
On window-system frames, value is the number of pixels the mouse may have
moved horizontally or vertically between two clicks to make a double-click.
On non window-system frames, value is interpreted in units of 1/8 characters
instead of pixels.Vinhibit-local-menu-bar-menus
*Non-nil means inhibit local map menu bar menus.Vnum-input-keys
Number of complete key sequences read as input so far.
This includes key sequences read from keyboard macros.
The number is effectively the number of interactive command invocations.Vnum-nonmacro-input-events
Number of input events read from the keyboard so far.
This does not include events generated by keyboard macros.Vlast-event-frame
The frame in which the most recently read event occurred.
If the last event came from a keyboard macro, this is set to `macro'.Vtty-erase-char
The ERASE character as set by the user with stty.Vhelp-char
Character to recognize as meaning Help.
When it is read, do `(eval help-form)', and display result if it's a string.
If the value of `help-form' is nil, this char can be read normally.Vhelp-event-list
List of input events to recognize as meaning Help.
These work just like the value of `help-char' (see that).Vhelp-form
Form to execute when character `help-char' is read.
If the form returns a string, that string is displayed.
If `help-form' is nil, the help char is not recognized.Vprefix-help-command
Command to run when `help-char' character follows a prefix key.
This command is used only when there is no actual binding
for that character after that prefix key.Vtop-level
Form to evaluate when Emacs starts up.
Useful to set before you dump a modified Emacs.Vkeyboard-translate-table
Translate table for keyboard input, or nil.
Each character is looked up in this string and the contents used instead.
The value may be a string, a vector, or a char-table.
If it is a string or vector of length N,
character codes N and up are untranslated.
In a vector or a char-table, an element which is nil means "no translation".Vcannot-suspend
Non-nil means to always spawn a subshell instead of suspending.
(Even if the operating system has support for stopping a process.)Vmenu-prompting
Non-nil means prompt with menus when appropriate.
This is done when reading from a keymap that has a prompt string,
for elements that have prompt strings.
The menu is displayed on the screen
if X menus were enabled at configuration
time and the previous event was a mouse click prefix key.
Otherwise, menu prompting uses the echo area.Vmenu-prompt-more-char
Character to see next line of menu prompt.
Type this character while in a menu prompt to rotate around the lines of it.Vextra-keyboard-modifiers
A mask of additional modifier keys to use with every keyboard character.
Emacs applies the modifiers of the character stored here to each keyboard
character it reads.  For example, after evaluating the expression
    (setq extra-keyboard-modifiers ?\C-x)
all input characters will have the control modifier applied to them.

Note that the character ?\C-@, equivalent to the integer zero, does
not count as a control character; rather, it counts as a character
with no modifiers; thus, setting `extra-keyboard-modifiers' to zero
cancels any modification.Vdeactivate-mark
If an editing command sets this to t, deactivate the mark afterward.
The command loop sets this to nil before each command,
and tests the value when the command returns.
Buffer modification stores t in this variable.Vcommand-hook-internal
Temporary storage of pre-command-hook or post-command-hook.Vpre-command-hook
Normal hook run before each command is executed.
If an unhandled error happens in running this hook,
the hook value is set to nil, since otherwise the error
might happen repeatedly and make Emacs nonfunctional.Vpost-command-hook
Normal hook run after each command is executed.
If an unhandled error happens in running this hook,
the hook value is set to nil, since otherwise the error
might happen repeatedly and make Emacs nonfunctional.Vpost-command-idle-hook
Normal hook run after each command is executed, if idle.
Errors running the hook are caught and ignored.
This feature is obsolete; use idle timers instead.  See `etc/NEWS'.Vpost-command-idle-delay
Delay time before running `post-command-idle-hook'.
This is measured in microseconds.Vecho-area-clear-hook
Normal hook run when clearing the echo area.Vlucid-menu-bar-dirty-flag
t means menu bar, specified Lucid style, needs to be recomputed.Vmenu-bar-final-items
List of menu bar items to move to the end of the menu bar.
The elements of the list are event types that may have menu bar bindings.Voverriding-terminal-local-map
Per-terminal keymap that overrides all other local keymaps.
If this variable is non-nil, it is used as a keymap instead of the
buffer's local map, and the minor mode keymaps and text property keymaps.
This variable is intended to let commands such as `universal-argument'
set up a different keymap for reading the next command.Voverriding-local-map
Keymap that overrides all other local keymaps.
If this variable is non-nil, it is used as a keymap instead of the
buffer's local map, and the minor mode keymaps and text property keymaps.Voverriding-local-map-menu-flag
Non-nil means `overriding-local-map' applies to the menu bar.
Otherwise, the menu bar continues to reflect the buffer's local map
and the minor mode maps regardless of `overriding-local-map'.Vspecial-event-map
Keymap defining bindings for special events to execute at low level.Vtrack-mouse
*Non-nil means generate motion events for mouse motion.Vsystem-key-alist
Alist of system-specific X windows key symbols.
Each element should have the form (N . SYMBOL) where N is the
numeric keysym code (sans the "system-specific" bit 1<<28)
and SYMBOL is its name.Vdeferred-action-list
List of deferred actions to be performed at a later time.
The precise format isn't relevant here; we just check whether it is nil.Vdeferred-action-function
Function to call to handle deferred actions, after each command.
This function is called with no arguments after each command
whenever `deferred-action-list' is non-nil.Vsuggest-key-bindings
*Non-nil means show the equivalent key-binding when M-x command has one.
The value can be a length of time to show the message for.
If the value is non-nil and not a number, we wait 2 seconds.Vtimer-list
List of active absolute time timers in order of increasing time.Vtimer-idle-list
List of active idle-time timers in order of increasing time.Vinput-method-function
If non-nil, the function that implements the current input method.
It's called with one argument, a printing character that was just read.
(That means a character with code 040...0176.)
Typically this function uses `read-event' to read additional events.
When it does so, it should first bind `input-method-function' to nil
so it will not be called recursively.

The function should return a list of zero or more events
to be used as input.  If it wants to put back some events
to be reconsidered, separately, by the input method,
it can add them to the beginning of `unread-command-events'.

The input method function can find in `input-method-previous-method'
the previous echo area message.

The input method function should refer to the variables
`input-method-use-echo-area' and `input-method-exit-on-first-char'
for guidance on what to do.Vinput-method-previous-message
When `input-method-function' is called, hold the previous echo area message.
This variable exists because `read-event' clears the echo area
before running the input method.  It is nil if there was no message.Vshow-help-function
If non-nil, the function that implements the display of help.
It's called with one argument, the help string to display.Vdisable-point-adjustment
If non-nil, suppress point adjustment after executing a command.

After a command is executed, if point is moved into a region that has
special properties (e.g. composition, display), we adjust point to
the boundary of the region.  But, several special commands sets this
variable to non-nil, then we suppress the point adjustment.

This variable is set to nil before reading a command, and is checked
just after executing the command.Vglobal-disable-point-adjustment
*If non-nil, always suppress point adjustment.

The default value is nil, in which case, point adjustment are
suppressed only after special commands that set
`disable-point-adjustment' (which see) to non-nil.Vupdate-menu-bindings
Non-nil means updating menu bindings is allowed.
A value of nil means menu bindings should not be updated.
Used during Emacs' startup.Vminibuffer-message-timeout
*How long to display an echo-area message when the minibuffer is active.
If the value is not a number, such messages don't time out.Fstart-kbd-macro
Record subsequent keyboard input, defining a keyboard macro.
The commands are recorded even as they are executed.
Use \[end-kbd-macro] to finish recording and make the macro available.
Use \[name-last-kbd-macro] to give it a permanent name.
Non-nil arg (prefix arg) means append to last macro defined;
this begins by re-executing that macro as if you typed it again.

(start-kbd-macro APPEND)Fend-kbd-macro
Finish defining a keyboard macro.
The definition was started by \[start-kbd-macro].
The macro is now available for use via \[call-last-kbd-macro],
or it can be given a name with \[name-last-kbd-macro] and then invoked
under that name.

With numeric arg, repeat macro now that many times,
counting the definition just completed as the first repetition.
An argument of zero means repeat until error.

(end-kbd-macro &optional REPEAT)Fcancel-kbd-macro-events
Cancel the events added to a keyboard macro for this command.

(cancel-kbd-macro-events)Fstore-kbd-macro-event
Store EVENT into the keyboard macro being defined.

(store-kbd-macro-event EVENT)Fcall-last-kbd-macro
Call the last keyboard macro that you defined with \[start-kbd-macro].

A prefix argument serves as a repeat count.  Zero means repeat until error.

To make a macro permanent so you can call it even after
defining others, use \[name-last-kbd-macro].

(call-last-kbd-macro &optional PREFIX)Fexecute-kbd-macro
Execute MACRO as string of editor command characters.
If MACRO is a symbol, its function definition is used.
COUNT is a repeat count, or nil for once, or 0 for infinite loop.

(execute-kbd-macro MACRO &optional COUNT)Vdefining-kbd-macro
Non-nil while a keyboard macro is being defined.  Don't set this!Vexecuting-macro
Currently executing keyboard macro (string or vector); nil if none executing.Vexecuting-kbd-macro
Currently executing keyboard macro (string or vector); nil if none executing.Vlast-kbd-macro
Last kbd macro defined, as a string or vector; nil if none defined.Fmake-keymap
Construct and return a new keymap, of the form (keymap CHARTABLE . ALIST).
CHARTABLE is a char-table that holds the bindings for the ASCII
characters.  ALIST is an assoc-list which holds bindings for function keys,
mouse events, and any other things that appear in the input stream.
All entries in it are initially nil, meaning "command undefined".

The optional arg STRING supplies a menu name for the keymap
in case you use it as a menu with `x-popup-menu'.

(make-keymap &optional STRING)Fmake-sparse-keymap
Construct and return a new sparse keymap.
Its car is `keymap' and its cdr is an alist of (CHAR . DEFINITION),
which binds the character CHAR to DEFINITION, or (SYMBOL . DEFINITION),
which binds the function key or mouse event SYMBOL to DEFINITION.
Initially the alist is nil.

The optional arg STRING supplies a menu name for the keymap
in case you use it as a menu with `x-popup-menu'.

(make-sparse-keymap &optional STRING)Fkeymapp
Return t if OBJECT is a keymap.

A keymap is a list (keymap . ALIST),
or a symbol whose function definition is itself a keymap.
ALIST elements look like (CHAR . DEFN) or (SYMBOL . DEFN);
a vector of densely packed bindings for small character codes
is also allowed as an element.

(keymapp OBJECT)Fkeymap-parent
Return the parent keymap of KEYMAP.

(keymap-parent KEYMAP)Fset-keymap-parent
Modify KEYMAP to set its parent map to PARENT.
PARENT should be nil or another keymap.

(set-keymap-parent KEYMAP PARENT)Fcopy-keymap
Return a copy of the keymap KEYMAP.
The copy starts out with the same definitions of KEYMAP,
but changing either the copy or KEYMAP does not affect the other.
Any key definitions that are subkeymaps are recursively copied.
However, a key definition which is a symbol whose definition is a keymap
is not copied.

(copy-keymap KEYMAP)Fdefine-key
Args KEYMAP, KEY, DEF.  Define key sequence KEY, in KEYMAP, as DEF.
KEYMAP is a keymap.  KEY is a string or a vector of symbols and characters
meaning a sequence of keystrokes and events.
Non-ASCII characters with codes above 127 (such as ISO Latin-1)
can be included if you use a vector.
DEF is anything that can be a key's definition:
 nil (means key is undefined in this keymap),
 a command (a Lisp function suitable for interactive calling)
 a string (treated as a keyboard macro),
 a keymap (to define a prefix key),
 a symbol.  When the key is looked up, the symbol will stand for its
    function definition, which should at that time be one of the above,
    or another symbol whose function definition is used, etc.
 a cons (STRING . DEFN), meaning that DEFN is the definition
    (DEFN should be a valid definition in its own right),
 or a cons (KEYMAP . CHAR), meaning use definition of CHAR in map KEYMAP.

If KEYMAP is a sparse keymap, the pair binding KEY to DEF is added at
the front of KEYMAP.

(define-key KEYMAP KEY DEF)Flookup-key
In keymap KEYMAP, look up key sequence KEY.  Return the definition.
nil means undefined.  See doc of `define-key' for kinds of definitions.

A number as value means KEY is "too long";
that is, characters or symbols in it except for the last one
fail to be a valid sequence of prefix characters in KEYMAP.
The number is how many characters at the front of KEY
it takes to reach a non-prefix command.

Normally, `lookup-key' ignores bindings for t, which act as default
bindings, used when nothing else in the keymap applies; this makes it
usable as a general function for probing keymaps.  However, if the
third optional argument ACCEPT-DEFAULT is non-nil, `lookup-key' will
recognize the default bindings, just as `read-key-sequence' does.

(lookup-key KEYMAP KEY &optional ACCEPT-DEFAULT)Fkey-binding
Return the binding for command KEY in current keymaps.
KEY is a string or vector, a sequence of keystrokes.
The binding is probably a symbol with a function definition.

Normally, `key-binding' ignores bindings for t, which act as default
bindings, used when nothing else in the keymap applies; this makes it
usable as a general function for probing keymaps.  However, if the
optional second argument ACCEPT-DEFAULT is non-nil, `key-binding' does
recognize the default bindings, just as `read-key-sequence' does.

(key-binding KEY &optional ACCEPT-DEFAULT)Flocal-key-binding
Return the binding for command KEYS in current local keymap only.
KEYS is a string, a sequence of keystrokes.
The binding is probably a symbol with a function definition.

If optional argument ACCEPT-DEFAULT is non-nil, recognize default
bindings; see the description of `lookup-key' for more details about this.

(local-key-binding KEYS &optional ACCEPT-DEFAULT)Fglobal-key-binding
Return the binding for command KEYS in current global keymap only.
KEYS is a string, a sequence of keystrokes.
The binding is probably a symbol with a function definition.
This function's return values are the same as those of lookup-key
(which see).

If optional argument ACCEPT-DEFAULT is non-nil, recognize default
bindings; see the description of `lookup-key' for more details about this.

(global-key-binding KEYS &optional ACCEPT-DEFAULT)Fminor-mode-key-binding
Find the visible minor mode bindings of KEY.
Return an alist of pairs (MODENAME . BINDING), where MODENAME is the
the symbol which names the minor mode binding KEY, and BINDING is
KEY's definition in that mode.  In particular, if KEY has no
minor-mode bindings, return nil.  If the first binding is a
non-prefix, all subsequent bindings will be omitted, since they would
be ignored.  Similarly, the list doesn't include non-prefix bindings
that come after prefix bindings.

If optional argument ACCEPT-DEFAULT is non-nil, recognize default
bindings; see the description of `lookup-key' for more details about this.

(minor-mode-key-binding KEY &optional ACCEPT-DEFAULT)Fdefine-prefix-command
Define COMMAND as a prefix command.  COMMAND should be a symbol.
A new sparse keymap is stored as COMMAND's function definition and its value.
If a second optional argument MAPVAR is given, the map is stored as
its value instead of as COMMAND's value; but COMMAND is still defined
as a function.
The third optional argument NAME, if given, supplies a menu name
string for the map.  This is required to use the keymap as a menu.

(define-prefix-command COMMAND &optional MAPVAR NAME)Fuse-global-map
Select KEYMAP as the global keymap.

(use-global-map KEYMAP)Fuse-local-map
Select KEYMAP as the local keymap.
If KEYMAP is nil, that means no local keymap.

(use-local-map KEYMAP)Fcurrent-local-map
Return current buffer's local keymap, or nil if it has none.

(current-local-map)Fcurrent-global-map
Return the current global keymap.

(current-global-map)Fcurrent-minor-mode-maps
Return a list of keymaps for the minor modes of the current buffer.

(current-minor-mode-maps)Faccessible-keymaps
Find all keymaps accessible via prefix characters from KEYMAP.
Returns a list of elements of the form (KEYS . MAP), where the sequence
KEYS starting from KEYMAP gets you to MAP.  These elements are ordered
so that the KEYS increase in length.  The first element is ([] . KEYMAP).
An optional argument PREFIX, if non-nil, should be a key sequence;
then the value includes only maps for prefixes that start with PREFIX.

(accessible-keymaps KEYMAP &optional PREFIX)Fkey-description
Return a pretty description of key-sequence KEYS.
Control characters turn into "C-foo" sequences, meta into "M-foo"
spaces are put between sequence elements, etc.

(key-description KEYS)Fsingle-key-description
Return a pretty description of command character KEY.
Control characters turn into C-whatever, etc.
Optional argument NO-ANGLES non-nil means don't put angle brackets
around function keys and event symbols.

(single-key-description KEY &optional NO-ANGLES)Ftext-char-description
Return a pretty description of file-character CHARACTER.
Control characters turn into "^char", etc.

(text-char-description CHARACTER)Fwhere-is-internal
Return list of keys that invoke DEFINITION.
If KEYMAP is non-nil, search only KEYMAP and the global keymap.
If KEYMAP is nil, search all the currently active keymaps.
If KEYMAP is a list of keymaps, search only those keymaps.

If optional 3rd arg FIRSTONLY is non-nil, return the first key sequence found,
rather than a list of all possible key sequences.
If FIRSTONLY is the symbol `non-ascii', return the first binding found,
no matter what it is.
If FIRSTONLY has another non-nil value, prefer sequences of ASCII characters,
and entirely reject menu bindings.

If optional 4th arg NOINDIRECT is non-nil, don't follow indirections
to other keymaps or slots.  This makes it possible to search for an
indirect definition itself.

(where-is-internal DEFINITION &optional KEYMAP FIRSTONLY NOINDIRECT)Fdescribe-bindings-internal
Show a list of all defined keys, and their definitions.
We put that list in a buffer, and display the buffer.

The optional argument MENUS, if non-nil, says to mention menu bindings.
(Ordinarily these are omitted from the output.)
The optional argument PREFIX, if non-nil, should be a key sequence;
then we display only bindings that start with that prefix.

(describe-bindings-internal &optional MENUS PREFIX)Fdescribe-vector
Insert a description of contents of VECTOR.
This is text showing the elements of vector matched against indices.

(describe-vector VECTOR)Fapropos-internal
Show all symbols whose names contain match for REGEXP.
If optional 2nd arg PREDICATE is non-nil, (funcall PREDICATE SYMBOL) is done
for each symbol and a symbol is mentioned only if that returns non-nil.
Return list of symbols found.

(apropos-internal REGEXP &optional PREDICATE)Vdefine-key-rebound-commands
List of commands given new key bindings recently.
This is used for internal purposes during Emacs startup;
don't alter it yourself.Vminibuffer-local-map
Default keymap to use when reading from the minibuffer.Vminibuffer-local-ns-map
Local keymap for the minibuffer when spaces are not allowed.Vminibuffer-local-completion-map
Local keymap for minibuffer input with completion.Vminibuffer-local-must-match-map
Local keymap for minibuffer input with completion, for exact match.Vminor-mode-map-alist
Alist of keymaps to use for minor modes.
Each element looks like (VARIABLE . KEYMAP); KEYMAP is used to read
key sequences and look up bindings iff VARIABLE's value is non-nil.
If two active keymaps bind the same key, the keymap appearing earlier
in the list takes precedence.Vminor-mode-overriding-map-alist
Alist of keymaps to use for minor modes, in current major mode.
This variable is a alist just like `minor-mode-map-alist', and it is
used the same way (and before `minor-mode-map-alist'); however,
it is provided for major modes to bind locally.Vfunction-key-map
Keymap mapping ASCII function key sequences onto their preferred forms.
This allows Emacs to recognize function keys sent from ASCII
terminals at any point in a key sequence.

The `read-key-sequence' function replaces any subsequence bound by
`function-key-map' with its binding.  More precisely, when the active
keymaps have no binding for the current key sequence but
`function-key-map' binds a suffix of the sequence to a vector or string,
`read-key-sequence' replaces the matching suffix with its binding, and
continues with the new sequence.

The events that come from bindings in `function-key-map' are not
themselves looked up in `function-key-map'.

For example, suppose `function-key-map' binds `ESC O P' to [f1].
Typing `ESC O P' to `read-key-sequence' would return [f1].  Typing
`C-x ESC O P' would return [?\C-x f1].  If [f1] were a prefix
key, typing `ESC O P x' would return [f1 x].Vkey-translation-map
Keymap of key translations that can override keymaps.
This keymap works like `function-key-map', but comes after that,
and applies even for keys that have ordinary bindings.Vdelete-exited-processes
*Non-nil means delete processes immediately when they exit.
nil means don't delete them until `list-processes' is run.Fbuffer-live-p
Return non-nil if OBJECT is a buffer which has not been killed.
Value is nil if OBJECT is not a buffer or if it has been killed.

(buffer-live-p OBJECT)Fbuffer-list
Return a list of all existing live buffers.
If the optional arg FRAME is a frame, we return that frame's buffer list.

(buffer-list &optional FRAME)Fget-buffer
Return the buffer named NAME (a string).
If there is no live buffer named NAME, return nil.
NAME may also be a buffer; if so, the value is that buffer.

(get-buffer NAME)Fget-file-buffer
Return the buffer visiting file FILENAME (a string).
The buffer's `buffer-file-name' must match exactly the expansion of FILENAME.
If there is no such live buffer, return nil.
See also `find-buffer-visiting'.

(get-file-buffer FILENAME)Fget-buffer-create
Return the buffer named NAME, or create such a buffer and return it.
A new buffer is created if there is no live buffer named NAME.
If NAME starts with a space, the new buffer does not keep undo information.
If NAME is a buffer instead of a string, then it is the value returned.
The value is never nil.

(get-buffer-create NAME)Fmake-indirect-buffer
Create and return an indirect buffer for buffer BASE-BUFFER, named NAME.
BASE-BUFFER should be an existing buffer (or buffer name).
NAME should be a string which is not the name of an existing buffer.
Optional argument CLONE non-nil means preserve BASE-BUFFER's state,
such as major and minor modes, in the indirect buffer.
CLONE nil means the indirect buffer's state is reset to default values.

(make-indirect-buffer BASE-BUFFER NAME &optional CLONE)Fgenerate-new-buffer-name
Return a string that is the name of no existing buffer based on NAME.
If there is no live buffer named NAME, then return NAME.
Otherwise modify name by appending `<NUMBER>', incrementing NUMBER
until an unused name is found, and then return that name.
Optional second argument IGNORE specifies a name that is okay to use
(if it is in the sequence to be tried)
even if a buffer with that name exists.

(generate-new-buffer-name NAME &optional IGNORE)Fbuffer-name
Return the name of BUFFER, as a string.
With no argument or nil as argument, return the name of the current buffer.

(buffer-name &optional BUFFER)Fbuffer-file-name
Return name of file BUFFER is visiting, or nil if none.
No argument or nil as argument means use the current buffer.

(buffer-file-name &optional BUFFER)Fbuffer-base-buffer
Return the base buffer of indirect buffer BUFFER.
If BUFFER is not indirect, return nil.

(buffer-base-buffer &optional BUFFER)Fbuffer-local-variables
Return an alist of variables that are buffer-local in BUFFER.
Most elements look like (SYMBOL . VALUE), describing one variable.
For a symbol that is locally unbound, just the symbol appears in the value.
Note that storing new VALUEs in these elements doesn't change the variables.
No argument or nil as argument means use current buffer as BUFFER.

(buffer-local-variables &optional BUFFER)Fbuffer-modified-p
Return t if BUFFER was modified since its file was last read or saved.
No argument or nil as argument means use current buffer as BUFFER.

(buffer-modified-p &optional BUFFER)Fset-buffer-modified-p
Mark current buffer as modified or unmodified according to FLAG.
A non-nil FLAG means mark the buffer modified.

(set-buffer-modified-p FLAG)Frestore-buffer-modified-p
Like `set-buffer-modified-p', with a differences concerning redisplay.
It is not ensured that mode lines will be updated to show the modified
state of the current buffer.  Use with care.

(restore-buffer-modified-p FLAG)Fbuffer-modified-tick
Return BUFFER's tick counter, incremented for each change in text.
Each buffer has a tick counter which is incremented each time the text in
that buffer is changed.  It wraps around occasionally.
No argument or nil as argument means use current buffer as BUFFER.

(buffer-modified-tick &optional BUFFER)Frename-buffer
Change current buffer's name to NEWNAME (a string).
If second arg UNIQUE is nil or omitted, it is an error if a
buffer named NEWNAME already exists.
If UNIQUE is non-nil, come up with a new name using
`generate-new-buffer-name'.
Interactively, you can set UNIQUE with a prefix argument.
We return the name we actually gave the buffer.
This does not change the name of the visited file (if any).

(rename-buffer NEWNAME &optional UNIQUE)Fother-buffer
Return most recently selected buffer other than BUFFER.
Buffers not visible in windows are preferred to visible buffers,
unless optional second argument VISIBLE-OK is non-nil.
If the optional third argument FRAME is non-nil, use that frame's
buffer list instead of the selected frame's buffer list.
If no other buffer exists, the buffer `*scratch*' is returned.
If BUFFER is omitted or nil, some interesting buffer is returned.

(other-buffer &optional BUFFER VISIBLE-OK FRAME)Fbuffer-disable-undo
Make BUFFER stop keeping undo information.
No argument or nil as argument means do this for the current buffer.

(buffer-disable-undo &optional BUFFER)Fbuffer-enable-undo
Start keeping undo information for buffer BUFFER.
No argument or nil as argument means do this for the current buffer.

(buffer-enable-undo &optional BUFFER)Vkill-buffer-hook
Hook to be run (by `run-hooks', which see) when a buffer is killed.
The buffer being killed will be current while the hook is running.
See `kill-buffer'.Fkill-buffer
Kill the buffer BUFFER.
The argument may be a buffer or may be the name of a buffer.
An argument of nil means kill the current buffer.

Value is t if the buffer is actually killed, nil if user says no.

The value of `kill-buffer-hook' (which may be local to that buffer),
if not void, is a list of functions to be called, with no arguments,
before the buffer is actually killed.  The buffer to be killed is current
when the hook functions are called.

Any processes that have this buffer as the `process-buffer' are killed
with SIGHUP.

(kill-buffer BUFFER)Fset-buffer-major-mode
Set an appropriate major mode for BUFFER.
For the *scratch* buffer use `initial-major-mode', otherwise choose a
mode according to `default-major-mode'.
Use this function before selecting the buffer, since it may need to inspect
the current buffer's major mode.

(set-buffer-major-mode BUFFER)Fswitch-to-buffer
Select buffer BUFFER in the current window.
BUFFER may be a buffer or a buffer name.
Optional second arg NORECORD non-nil means
do not put this buffer at the front of the list of recently selected ones.

WARNING: This is NOT the way to work on another buffer temporarily
within a Lisp program!  Use `set-buffer' instead.  That avoids messing with
the window-buffer correspondences.

(switch-to-buffer BUFFER &optional NORECORD)Fpop-to-buffer
Select buffer BUFFER in some window, preferably a different one.
If BUFFER is nil, then some other buffer is chosen.
If `pop-up-windows' is non-nil, windows can be split to do this.
If optional second arg OTHER-WINDOW is non-nil, insist on finding another
window even if BUFFER is already visible in the selected window.
This uses the function `display-buffer' as a subroutine; see the documentation
of `display-buffer' for additional customization information.

Optional third arg NORECORD non-nil means
do not put this buffer at the front of the list of recently selected ones.

(pop-to-buffer BUFFER &optional OTHER-WINDOW NORECORD)Fcurrent-buffer
Return the current buffer as a Lisp object.

(current-buffer)Fset-buffer
Make the buffer BUFFER current for editing operations.
BUFFER may be a buffer or the name of an existing buffer.
See also `save-excursion' when you want to make a buffer current temporarily.
This function does not display the buffer, so its effect ends
when the current command terminates.
Use `switch-to-buffer' or `pop-to-buffer' to switch buffers permanently.

(set-buffer BUFFER)Fbarf-if-buffer-read-only
Signal a `buffer-read-only' error if the current buffer is read-only.

(barf-if-buffer-read-only)Fbury-buffer
Put BUFFER at the end of the list of all buffers.
There it is the least likely candidate for `other-buffer' to return;
thus, the least likely buffer for \[switch-to-buffer] to select by default.
If BUFFER is nil or omitted, bury the current buffer.
Also, if BUFFER is nil or omitted, remove the current buffer from the
selected window if it is displayed there.

(bury-buffer &optional BUFFER)Ferase-buffer
Delete the entire contents of the current buffer.
Any narrowing restriction in effect (see `narrow-to-region') is removed,
so the buffer is truly empty after this.

(erase-buffer)Fset-buffer-multibyte
Set the multibyte flag of the current buffer to FLAG.
If FLAG is t, this makes the buffer a multibyte buffer.
If FLAG is nil, this makes the buffer a single-byte buffer.
The buffer contents remain unchanged as a sequence of bytes
but the contents viewed as characters do change.

(set-buffer-multibyte FLAG)Fkill-all-local-variables
Switch to Fundamental mode by killing current buffer's local variables.
Most local variable bindings are eliminated so that the default values
become effective once more.  Also, the syntax table is set from
`standard-syntax-table', the local keymap is set to nil,
and the abbrev table from `fundamental-mode-abbrev-table'.
This function also forces redisplay of the mode line.

Every function to select a new major mode starts by
calling this function.

As a special exception, local variables whose names have
a non-nil `permanent-local' property are not eliminated by this function.

The first thing this function does is run
the normal hook `change-major-mode-hook'.

(kill-all-local-variables)Foverlayp
Return t if OBJECT is an overlay.

(overlayp OBJECT)Fmake-overlay
Create a new overlay with range BEG to END in BUFFER.
If omitted, BUFFER defaults to the current buffer.
BEG and END may be integers or markers.
The fourth arg FRONT-ADVANCE, if non-nil, makes the
front delimiter advance when text is inserted there.
The fifth arg REAR-ADVANCE, if non-nil, makes the
rear delimiter advance when text is inserted there.

(make-overlay BEG END &optional BUFFER FRONT-ADVANCE REAR-ADVANCE)Fmove-overlay
Set the endpoints of OVERLAY to BEG and END in BUFFER.
If BUFFER is omitted, leave OVERLAY in the same buffer it inhabits now.
If BUFFER is omitted, and OVERLAY is in no buffer, put it in the current
buffer.

(move-overlay OVERLAY BEG END &optional BUFFER)Fdelete-overlay
Delete the overlay OVERLAY from its buffer.

(delete-overlay OVERLAY)Foverlay-start
Return the position at which OVERLAY starts.

(overlay-start OVERLAY)Foverlay-end
Return the position at which OVERLAY ends.

(overlay-end OVERLAY)Foverlay-buffer
Return the buffer OVERLAY belongs to.

(overlay-buffer OVERLAY)Foverlay-properties
Return a list of the properties on OVERLAY.
This is a copy of OVERLAY's plist; modifying its conses has no effect on
OVERLAY.

(overlay-properties OVERLAY)Foverlays-at
Return a list of the overlays that contain position POS.

(overlays-at POS)Foverlays-in
Return a list of the overlays that overlap the region BEG ... END.
Overlap means that at least one character is contained within the overlay
and also contained within the specified region.
Empty overlays are included in the result if they are located at BEG
or between BEG and END.

(overlays-in BEG END)Fnext-overlay-change
Return the next position after POS where an overlay starts or ends.
If there are no more overlay boundaries after POS, return (point-max).

(next-overlay-change POS)Fprevious-overlay-change
Return the previous position before POS where an overlay starts or ends.
If there are no more overlay boundaries before POS, return (point-min).

(previous-overlay-change POS)Foverlay-lists
Return a pair of lists giving all the overlays of the current buffer.
The car has all the overlays before the overlay center;
the cdr has all the overlays after the overlay center.
Recentering overlays moves overlays between these lists.
The lists you get are copies, so that changing them has no effect.
However, the overlays you get are the real objects that the buffer uses.

(overlay-lists)Foverlay-recenter
Recenter the overlays of the current buffer around position POS.

(overlay-recenter POS)Foverlay-get
Get the property of overlay OVERLAY with property name PROP.

(overlay-get OVERLAY PROP)Foverlay-put
Set one property of overlay OVERLAY: give property PROP value VALUE.

(overlay-put OVERLAY PROP VALUE)Vdefault-mode-line-format
Default value of `mode-line-format' for buffers that don't override it.
This is the same as (default-value 'mode-line-format).Vdefault-header-line-format
Default value of `header-line-format' for buffers that don't override it.
This is the same as (default-value 'header-line-format).Vdefault-cursor-type
Default value of `cursor-type' for buffers that don't override it.
This is the same as (default-value 'cursor-type).Vdefault-line-spacing
Default value of `line-spacing' for buffers that don't override it.
This is the same as (default-value 'line-spacing).Vdefault-abbrev-mode
Default value of `abbrev-mode' for buffers that do not override it.
This is the same as (default-value 'abbrev-mode).Vdefault-ctl-arrow
Default value of `ctl-arrow' for buffers that do not override it.
This is the same as (default-value 'ctl-arrow).Vdefault-direction-reversed
Default value of `direction_reversed' for buffers that do not override it.
 This is the same as (default-value 'direction-reversed).Vdefault-enable-multibyte-characters
*Default value of `enable-multibyte-characters' for buffers not overriding it.
This is the same as (default-value 'enable-multibyte-characters).Vdefault-buffer-file-coding-system
Default value of `buffer-file-coding-system' for buffers not overriding it.
This is the same as (default-value 'buffer-file-coding-system).Vdefault-truncate-lines
Default value of `truncate-lines' for buffers that do not override it.
This is the same as (default-value 'truncate-lines).Vdefault-fill-column
Default value of `fill-column' for buffers that do not override it.
This is the same as (default-value 'fill-column).Vdefault-left-margin
Default value of `left-margin' for buffers that do not override it.
This is the same as (default-value 'left-margin).Vdefault-tab-width
Default value of `tab-width' for buffers that do not override it.
This is the same as (default-value 'tab-width).Vdefault-case-fold-search
Default value of `case-fold-search' for buffers that don't override it.
This is the same as (default-value 'case-fold-search).Vdefault-buffer-file-type
Default file type for buffers that do not override it.
This is the same as (default-value 'buffer-file-type).
The file type is nil for text, t for binary.Vdefault-left-margin-width
Default value of `left-margin-width' for buffers that don't override it.
This is the same as (default-value 'left-margin-width).Vdefault-right-margin-width
Default value of `right_margin_width' for buffers that don't override it.
This is the same as (default-value 'right-margin-width).Vdefault-indicate-empty-lines
Default value of `indicate-empty-lines' for buffers that don't override it.
This is the same as (default-value 'indicate-empty-lines).Vdefault-scroll-up-aggressively
Default value of `scroll-up-aggressively' for buffers that
don't override it.  This is the same as (default-value
'scroll-up-aggressively).Vdefault-scroll-down-aggressively
Default value of `scroll-down-aggressively' for buffers that
don't override it.  This is the same as (default-value
'scroll-down-aggressively).Vheader-line-format
Analogous to `mode-line-format', but for the mode line that can be
displayed at the top of a window.Vmode-line-format
Template for displaying mode line for current buffer.
Each buffer has its own value of this variable.
Value may be nil, a string, a symbol or a list or cons cell.
A value of nil means don't display a mode line.
For a symbol, its value is used (but it is ignored if t or nil).
 A string appearing directly as the value of a symbol is processed verbatim
 in that the %-constructs below are not recognized.
For a list of the form `(:eval FORM)', FORM is evaluated and the result
 is used as a mode line element.
For a list whose car is a symbol, the symbol's value is taken,
 and if that is non-nil, the cadr of the list is processed recursively.
 Otherwise, the caddr of the list (if there is one) is processed.
For a list whose car is a string or list, each element is processed
 recursively and the results are effectively concatenated.
For a list whose car is an integer, the cdr of the list is processed
  and padded (if the number is positive) or truncated (if negative)
  to the width specified by that number.
A string is printed verbatim in the mode line except for %-constructs:
  (%-constructs are allowed when the string is the entire mode-line-format
   or when it is found in a cons-cell or a list)
  %b -- print buffer name.      %f -- print visited file name.
  %F -- print frame name.
  %* -- print %, * or hyphen.   %+ -- print *, % or hyphen.
	%& is like %*, but ignore read-only-ness.
	% means buffer is read-only and * means it is modified.
	For a modified read-only buffer, %* gives % and %+ gives *.
  %s -- print process status.   %l -- print the current line number.
  %c -- print the current column number (this makes editing slower).
        To make the column number update correctly in all cases,
	`column-number-mode' must be non-nil.
  %p -- print percent of buffer above top of window, or Top, Bot or All.
  %P -- print percent of buffer above bottom of window, perhaps plus Top,
        or print Bottom or All.
  %m -- print the mode name.
  %n -- print Narrow if appropriate.
  %z -- print mnemonics of buffer, terminal, and keyboard coding systems.
  %Z -- like %z, but including the end-of-line format.
  %[ -- print one [ for each recursive editing level.  %] similar.
  %% -- print %.   %- -- print infinitely many dashes.
Decimal digits after the % specify field width to which to pad.Vdefault-major-mode
*Major mode for new buffers.  Defaults to `fundamental-mode'.
nil here means use current buffer's major mode.Vmajor-mode
Symbol for current buffer's major mode.Vmode-name
Pretty name of current buffer's major mode (a string).Vabbrev-mode
Non-nil turns on automatic expansion of abbrevs as they are inserted.
Automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any fashion.Vcase-fold-search
*Non-nil if searches and matches should ignore case.
Automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any fashion.Vfill-column
*Column beyond which automatic line-wrapping should happen.
Automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any fashion.Vleft-margin
*Column for the default indent-line-function to indent to.
Linefeed indents to this column in Fundamental mode.
Automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any fashion.Vtab-width
*Distance between tab stops (for display of tab characters), in columns.
Automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any fashion.Vctl-arrow
*Non-nil means display control chars with uparrow.
A value of nil means use backslash and octal digits.
Automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any fashion.
This variable does not apply to characters whose display is specified
in the current display table (if there is one).Venable-multibyte-characters
Non-nil means the buffer contents are regarded as multi-byte characters.
Otherwise they are regarded as unibyte.  This affects the display,
file I/O and the behavior of various editing commands.

This variable is buffer-local but you cannot set it directly;
use the function `set-buffer-multibyte' to change a buffer's representation.
Changing its default value with `setq-default' is supported.
See also variable `default-enable-multibyte-characters' and Info node
`(elisp)Text Representations'.Vbuffer-file-coding-system
Coding system to be used for encoding the buffer contents on saving.
This variable applies to saving the buffer, and also to `write-region'
and other functions that use `write-region'.
It does not apply to sending output to subprocesses, however.

If this is nil, the buffer is saved without any code conversion
unless some coding system is specified in `file-coding-system-alist'
for the buffer file.

The variable `coding-system-for-write', if non-nil, overrides this variable.

This variable is never applied to a way of decoding
a file while reading it.Vdirection-reversed
*Non-nil means lines in the buffer are displayed right to left.Vtruncate-lines
*Non-nil means do not display continuation lines;
give each line of text one screen line.
Automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any fashion.

Note that this is overridden by the variable
`truncate-partial-width-windows' if that variable is non-nil
and this buffer is not full-frame width.Vbuffer-file-type
Non-nil if the visited file is a binary file.
This variable is meaningful on MS-DOG and Windows NT.
On those systems, it is automatically local in every buffer.
On other systems, this variable is normally always nil.Vdefault-directory
Name of default directory of current buffer.  Should end with slash.
Each buffer has its own value of this variable.  To change the
default directory, use function `cd'.Vauto-fill-function
Function called (if non-nil) to perform auto-fill.
It is called after self-inserting any character specified in
the `auto-fill-chars' table.
Each buffer has its own value of this variable.
NOTE: This variable is not a hook;
its value may not be a list of functions.Vbuffer-file-name
Name of file visited in current buffer, or nil if not visiting a file.
Each buffer has its own value of this variable.Vbuffer-file-truename
Abbreviated truename of file visited in current buffer, or nil if none.
The truename of a file is calculated by `file-truename'
and then abbreviated with `abbreviate-file-name'.
Each buffer has its own value of this variable.Vbuffer-auto-save-file-name
Name of file for auto-saving current buffer,
or nil if buffer should not be auto-saved.
Each buffer has its own value of this variable.Vbuffer-read-only
Non-nil if this buffer is read-only.
Each buffer has its own value of this variable.Vbuffer-backed-up
Non-nil if this buffer's file has been backed up.
Backing up is done before the first time the file is saved.
Each buffer has its own value of this variable.Vbuffer-saved-size
Length of current buffer when last read in, saved or auto-saved.
0 initially.
Each buffer has its own value of this variable.Vselective-display
Non-nil enables selective display:
Integer N as value means display only lines
 that start with less than n columns of space.
A value of t means, after a ^M, all the rest of the line is invisible.
 Then ^M's in the file are written into files as newlines.

Automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any fashion.Vselective-display-ellipses
t means display ... on previous line when a line is invisible.
Automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any fashion.Voverwrite-mode
Non-nil if self-insertion should replace existing text.
The value should be one of `overwrite-mode-textual',
`overwrite-mode-binary', or nil.
If it is `overwrite-mode-textual', self-insertion still
inserts at the end of a line, and inserts when point is before a tab,
until the tab is filled in.
If `overwrite-mode-binary', self-insertion replaces newlines and tabs too.
Automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any fashion.Vbuffer-display-table
Display table that controls display of the contents of current buffer.
Automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any fashion.

If this variable is nil, the value of `standard-display-table' is used.
Each window can have its own, overriding display table, see
`set-window-display-table' and `window-display-table'.

The display table is a char-table created with `make-display-table'.
A char-table is an array indexed by character codes.  Normal array
primitives `aref' and `aset' can be used to access elements of a char-table.

Each of the char-table elements control how to display the corresponding
text character: the element at index C in the table says how to display
the character whose code is C.  Each element should be a vector of
characters or nil.  nil means display the character in the default fashion;
otherwise, the characters from the vector are delivered to the screen
instead of the original character.

For example, (aset buffer-display-table ?X ?Y) will cause Emacs to display
a capital Y instead of each X character.

In addition, a char-table has six extra slots to control the display of:

  the end of a truncated screen line (extra-slot 0, a single character);
  the end of a continued line (extra-slot 1, a single character);
  the escape character used to display character codes in octal
    (extra-slot 2, a single character);
  the character used as an arrow for control characters (extra-slot 3,
    a single character);
  the decoration indicating the presence of invisible lines (extra-slot 4,
    a vector of characters);
  the character used to draw the border between side-by-side windows
    (extra-slot 5, a single character).

See also the functions `display-table-slot' and `set-display-table-slot'.Vleft-margin-width
*Width of left marginal area for display of a buffer.
Automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any fashion.
A value of nil means no marginal area.Vright-margin-width
*Width of right marginal area for display of a buffer.
Automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any fashion.
A value of nil means no marginal area.Vindicate-empty-lines
*Visually indicate empty lines after the buffer end.
If non-nil, a bitmap is displayed in the left fringe of a window on
window-systems.
Automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any fashion.
Vscroll-up-aggressively
*If a number, scroll display up aggressively.
If scrolling a window because point is below the window end, choose
a new window start so that point ends up that fraction of the window's
height from the bottom of the window.
Automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any fashion.Vscroll-down-aggressively
*If a number, scroll display down aggressively.
If scrolling a window because point is above the window start, choose
a new window start so that point ends up that fraction of the window's
height from the top of the window.
Automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any fashion.Vbefore-change-functions
List of functions to call before each text change.
Two arguments are passed to each function: the positions of
the beginning and end of the range of old text to be changed.
(For an insertion, the beginning and end are at the same place.)
No information is given about the length of the text after the change.

Buffer changes made while executing the `before-change-functions'
don't call any before-change or after-change functions.
That's because these variables are temporarily set to nil.
As a result, a hook function cannot straightforwardly alter the value of
these variables.  See the Emacs Lisp manual for a way of
accomplishing an equivalent result by using other variables.

If an unhandled error happens in running these functions,
the variable's value remains nil.  That prevents the error
from happening repeatedly and making Emacs nonfunctional.Vafter-change-functions
List of function to call after each text change.
Three arguments are passed to each function: the positions of
the beginning and end of the range of changed text,
and the length in bytes of the pre-change text replaced by that range.
(For an insertion, the pre-change length is zero;
for a deletion, that length is the number of bytes deleted,
and the post-change beginning and end are at the same place.)

Buffer changes made while executing the `after-change-functions'
don't call any before-change or after-change functions.
That's because these variables are temporarily set to nil.
As a result, a hook function cannot straightforwardly alter the value of
these variables.  See the Emacs Lisp manual for a way of
accomplishing an equivalent result by using other variables.

If an unhandled error happens in running these functions,
the variable's value remains nil.  That prevents the error
from happening repeatedly and making Emacs nonfunctional.Vfirst-change-hook
A list of functions to call before changing a buffer which is unmodified.
The functions are run using the `run-hooks' function.Vbuffer-undo-list
List of undo entries in current buffer.
This variable is always local in all buffers.
Recent changes come first; older changes follow newer.

An entry (BEG . END) represents an insertion which begins at
position BEG and ends at position END.

An entry (TEXT . POSITION) represents the deletion of the string TEXT
from (abs POSITION).  If POSITION is positive, point was at the front
of the text being deleted; if negative, point was at the end.

An entry (t HIGH . LOW) indicates that the buffer previously had
"unmodified" status.  HIGH and LOW are the high and low 16-bit portions
of the visited file's modification time, as of that time.  If the
modification time of the most recent save is different, this entry is
obsolete.

An entry (nil PROPERTY VALUE BEG . END) indicates that a text property
was modified between BEG and END.  PROPERTY is the property name,
and VALUE is the old value.

An entry (MARKER . DISTANCE) indicates that the marker MARKER
was adjusted in position by the offset DISTANCE (an integer).

An entry of the form POSITION indicates that point was at the buffer
location given by the integer.  Undoing an entry of this form places
point at POSITION.

nil marks undo boundaries.  The undo command treats the changes
between two undo boundaries as a single step to be undone.

If the value of the variable is t, undo information is not recorded.Vmark-active
Non-nil means the mark and region are currently active in this buffer.
Automatically local in all buffers.Vcache-long-line-scans
Non-nil means that Emacs should use caches to handle long lines more quickly.
This variable is buffer-local, in all buffers.

Normally, the line-motion functions work by scanning the buffer for
newlines.  Columnar operations (like move-to-column and
compute-motion) also work by scanning the buffer, summing character
widths as they go.  This works well for ordinary text, but if the
buffer's lines are very long (say, more than 500 characters), these
motion functions will take longer to execute.  Emacs may also take
longer to update the display.

If cache-long-line-scans is non-nil, these motion functions cache the
results of their scans, and consult the cache to avoid rescanning
regions of the buffer until the text is modified.  The caches are most
beneficial when they prevent the most searching---that is, when the
buffer contains long lines and large regions of characters with the
same, fixed screen width.

When cache-long-line-scans is non-nil, processing short lines will
become slightly slower (because of the overhead of consulting the
cache), and the caches will use memory roughly proportional to the
number of newlines and characters whose screen width varies.

The caches require no explicit maintenance; their accuracy is
maintained internally by the Emacs primitives.  Enabling or disabling
the cache should not affect the behavior of any of the motion
functions; it should only affect their performance.Vpoint-before-scroll
Value of point before the last series of scroll operations, or nil.
This variable is always local in all buffers.Vbuffer-file-format
List of formats to use when saving this buffer.
This variable is always local in all buffers.
Formats are defined by `format-alist'.  This variable is
set when a file is visited.  Automatically local in all buffers.Vbuffer-invisibility-spec
Invisibility spec of this buffer.
This variable is always local in all buffers.
The default is t, which means that text is invisible
if it has a non-nil `invisible' property.
If the value is a list, a text character is invisible if its `invisible'
property is an element in that list.
If an element is a cons cell of the form (PROP . ELLIPSIS),
then characters with property value PROP are invisible,
and they have an ellipsis as well if ELLIPSIS is non-nil.Vbuffer-display-count
A number incremented each time this buffer is displayed in a window.
This variable is always local in all buffers.
The function `set-window-buffer increments it.Vbuffer-display-time
Time stamp updated each time this buffer is displayed in a window.
This variable is always local in all buffers.
The function `set-window-buffer' updates this variable
to the value obtained by calling `current-time'.
If the buffer has never been shown in a window, the value is nil.Vtransient-mark-mode
*Non-nil means deactivate the mark when the buffer contents change.
Non-nil also enables highlighting of the region whenever the mark is active.
The variable `highlight-nonselected-windows' controls whether to highlight
all windows or just the selected window.Vinhibit-read-only
*Non-nil means disregard read-only status of buffers or characters.
If the value is t, disregard `buffer-read-only' and all `read-only'
text properties.  If the value is a list, disregard `buffer-read-only'
and disregard a `read-only' text property if the property value
is a member of the list.Vcursor-type
Cursor to use in window displaying this buffer.
Values are interpreted as follows:

  t 		use the cursor specified for the frame
  nil		don't display a cursor
  `bar'		display a bar cursor with default width
  (bar . WIDTH)	display a bar cursor with width WIDTH
  others	display a box cursor.Vline-spacing
Additional space to put between lines when displaying a buffer.
The space is measured in pixels, and put below lines on window systems.Vkill-buffer-query-functions
List of functions called with no args to query before killing a buffer.Flock-buffer
Lock FILE, if current buffer is modified.
FILE defaults to current buffer's visited file,
or else nothing is done if current buffer isn't visiting a file.

(lock-buffer &optional FILE)Funlock-buffer
Unlock the file visited in the current buffer,
if it should normally be locked.

(unlock-buffer)Ffile-locked-p
Return nil if the FILENAME is not locked,
t if it is locked by you, else a string of the name of the locker.

(file-locked-p FILENAME)Vtemporary-file-directory
The directory for writing temporary files.Fcombine-after-change-execute
This function is for use internally in `combine-after-change-calls'.

(combine-after-change-execute)Vcheck-markers-debug-flag
Non-nil means enable debugging checks for invalid marker positions.Vcombine-after-change-calls
Used internally by the `combine-after-change-calls' macro.Vinhibit-modification-hooks
Non-nil means don't run any of the hooks that respond to buffer changes.
This affects `before-change-functions' and `after-change-functions',
as well as hooks attached to text properties and overlays.Fmarker-buffer
Return the buffer that MARKER points into, or nil if none.
Returns nil if MARKER points into a dead buffer.

(marker-buffer MARKER)Fmarker-position
Return the position MARKER points at, as a character number.

(marker-position MARKER)Fset-marker
Position MARKER before character number POSITION in BUFFER.
BUFFER defaults to the current buffer.
If POSITION is nil, makes marker point nowhere.
Then it no longer slows down editing in any buffer.
Returns MARKER.

(set-marker MARKER POSITION &optional BUFFER)Fcopy-marker
Return a new marker pointing at the same place as MARKER.
If argument is a number, makes a new marker pointing
at that position in the current buffer.
The optional argument TYPE specifies the insertion type of the new marker;
see `marker-insertion-type'.

(copy-marker MARKER &optional TYPE)Fmarker-insertion-type
Return insertion type of MARKER: t if it stays after inserted text.
nil means the marker stays before text inserted there.

(marker-insertion-type MARKER)Fset-marker-insertion-type
Set the insertion-type of MARKER to TYPE.
If TYPE is t, it means the marker advances when you insert text at it.
If TYPE is nil, it means the marker stays behind when you insert text at it.

(set-marker-insertion-type MARKER TYPE)Fbuffer-has-markers-at
Return t if there are markers pointing at POSITION in the current buffer.

(buffer-has-markers-at POSITION)Vbyte-debug-flag
Non-nil enables debugging checks in byte/char position conversions.Fset-minibuffer-window
Specify which minibuffer window to use for the minibuffer.
This effects where the minibuffer is displayed if you put text in it
without invoking the usual minibuffer commands.

(set-minibuffer-window WINDOW)Fread-from-minibuffer
Read a string from the minibuffer, prompting with string PROMPT.
If optional second arg INITIAL-CONTENTS is non-nil, it is a string
  to be inserted into the minibuffer before reading input.
  If INITIAL-CONTENTS is (STRING . POSITION), the initial input
  is STRING, but point is placed at position POSITION in the minibuffer.
Third arg KEYMAP is a keymap to use whilst reading;
  if omitted or nil, the default is `minibuffer-local-map'.
If fourth arg READ is non-nil, then interpret the result as a lisp object
  and return that object:
  in other words, do `(car (read-from-string INPUT-STRING))'
Fifth arg HIST, if non-nil, specifies a history list
  and optionally the initial position in the list.
  It can be a symbol, which is the history list variable to use,
  or it can be a cons cell (HISTVAR . HISTPOS).
  In that case, HISTVAR is the history list variable to use,
  and HISTPOS is the initial position (the position in the list
  which INITIAL-CONTENTS corresponds to).
  Positions are counted starting from 1 at the beginning of the list.
Sixth arg DEFAULT-VALUE is the default value.  If non-nil, it is available
 for history commands; but `read-from-minibuffer' does NOT return DEFAULT-VALUE
 if the user enters empty input!  It returns the empty string.
Seventh arg INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD, if non-nil, means the minibuffer inherits
 the current input method and the setting of enable-multibyte-characters.
If the variable `minibuffer-allow-text-properties' is non-nil,
 then the string which is returned includes whatever text properties
 were present in the minibuffer.  Otherwise the value has no text properties.

(read-from-minibuffer PROMPT &optional INITIAL-CONTENTS KEYMAP READ HIST DEFAULT-VALUE INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD)Fread-minibuffer
Return a Lisp object read using the minibuffer.
Prompt with PROMPT.  If non-nil, optional second arg INITIAL-CONTENTS
is a string to insert in the minibuffer before reading.

(read-minibuffer PROMPT &optional INITIAL-CONTENTS)Feval-minibuffer

Read a string from the minibuffer, prompting with string PROMPT.
If non-nil, second arg INITIAL-INPUT is a string to insert before reading.
The third arg HISTORY, if non-nil, specifies a history list
  and optionally the initial position in the list.
See `read-from-minibuffer' for details of HISTORY argument.
Fourth arg DEFAULT-VALUE is the default value.  If non-nil, it is used
 for history commands, and as the value to return if the user enters
 the empty string.
Fifth arg INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD, if non-nil, means the minibuffer inherits
 the current input method and the setting of enable-multibyte-characters.

(read-string PROMPT &optional INITIAL-INPUT HISTORY DEFAULT-VALUE INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD)Fread-no-blanks-input
Read a string from the terminal, not allowing blanks.
Prompt with PROMPT, and provide INITIAL as an initial value of the input string.
Third arg INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD, if non-nil, means the minibuffer inherits
the current input method and the setting of enable-multibyte-characters.

(read-no-blanks-input PROMPT &optional INITIAL INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD)Fread-command
Read the name of a command and return as a symbol.
Prompts with PROMPT.  By default, return DEFAULT-VALUE.

(read-command PROMPT &optional DEFAULT-VALUE)Fread-function
One arg PROMPT, a string.  Read the name of a function and return as a symbol.
Prompts with PROMPT.

(read-function PROMPT)Fread-variable
Read the name of a user variable and return it as a symbol.
Prompts with PROMPT.  By default, return DEFAULT-VALUE.
A user variable is one whose documentation starts with a `*' character.

(read-variable PROMPT &optional DEFAULT-VALUE)Fread-buffer
One arg PROMPT, a string.  Read the name of a buffer and return as a string.
Prompts with PROMPT.
Optional second arg DEF is value to return if user enters an empty line.
If optional third arg REQUIRE-MATCH is non-nil, only existing buffer names are allowed.

(read-buffer PROMPT &optional DEF REQUIRE-MATCH)Ftry-completion
Return common substring of all completions of STRING in ALIST.
Each car of each element of ALIST is tested to see if it begins with STRING.
All that match are compared together; the longest initial sequence
common to all matches is returned as a string.
If there is no match at all, nil is returned.
For a unique match which is exact, t is returned.

ALIST can be an obarray instead of an alist.
Then the print names of all symbols in the obarray are the possible matches.

ALIST can also be a function to do the completion itself.
It receives three arguments: the values STRING, PREDICATE and nil.
Whatever it returns becomes the value of `try-completion'.

If optional third argument PREDICATE is non-nil,
it is used to test each possible match.
The match is a candidate only if PREDICATE returns non-nil.
The argument given to PREDICATE is the alist element
or the symbol from the obarray.
Additionally to this predicate, `completion-regexp-list'
is used to further constrain the set of candidates.

(try-completion STRING ALIST &optional PREDICATE)Fall-completions
Search for partial matches to STRING in ALIST.
Each car of each element of ALIST is tested to see if it begins with STRING.
The value is a list of all the strings from ALIST that match.

ALIST can be an obarray instead of an alist.
Then the print names of all symbols in the obarray are the possible matches.

ALIST can also be a function to do the completion itself.
It receives three arguments: the values STRING, PREDICATE and t.
Whatever it returns becomes the value of `all-completions'.

If optional third argument PREDICATE is non-nil,
it is used to test each possible match.
The match is a candidate only if PREDICATE returns non-nil.
The argument given to PREDICATE is the alist element
or the symbol from the obarray.
Additionally to this predicate, `completion-regexp-list'
is used to further constrain the set of candidates.

If the optional fourth argument HIDE-SPACES is non-nil,
strings in ALIST that start with a space
are ignored unless STRING itself starts with a space.

(all-completions STRING ALIST &optional PREDICATE HIDE-SPACES)Fcompleting-read
Read a string in the minibuffer, with completion.
PROMPT is a string to prompt with; normally it ends in a colon and a space.
TABLE is an alist whose elements' cars are strings, or an obarray.
TABLE can also be a function to do the completion itself.
PREDICATE limits completion to a subset of TABLE.
See `try-completion' and `all-completions' for more details
 on completion, TABLE, and PREDICATE.

If REQUIRE-MATCH is non-nil, the user is not allowed to exit unless
 the input is (or completes to) an element of TABLE or is null.
 If it is also not t, Return does not exit if it does non-null completion.
If the input is null, `completing-read' returns an empty string,
 regardless of the value of REQUIRE-MATCH.

If INITIAL-INPUT is non-nil, insert it in the minibuffer initially.
  If it is (STRING . POSITION), the initial input
  is STRING, but point is placed POSITION characters into the string.
  This feature is deprecated--it is best to pass nil for INITIAL.
HIST, if non-nil, specifies a history list
  and optionally the initial position in the list.
  It can be a symbol, which is the history list variable to use,
  or it can be a cons cell (HISTVAR . HISTPOS).
  In that case, HISTVAR is the history list variable to use,
  and HISTPOS is the initial position (the position in the list
  which INITIAL-INPUT corresponds to).
  Positions are counted starting from 1 at the beginning of the list.
DEF, if non-nil, is the default value.

If INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD is non-nil, the minibuffer inherits
  the current input method and the setting of enable-multibyte-characters.

Completion ignores case if the ambient value of
  `completion-ignore-case' is non-nil.

(completing-read PROMPT TABLE &optional PREDICATE REQUIRE-MATCH INITIAL-INPUT HIST DEF INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD)Fminibuffer-complete
Complete the minibuffer contents as far as possible.
Return nil if there is no valid completion, else t.
If no characters can be completed, display a list of possible completions.
If you repeat this command after it displayed such a list,
scroll the window of possible completions.

(minibuffer-complete)Fminibuffer-complete-and-exit
If the minibuffer contents is a valid completion then exit.
Otherwise try to complete it.  If completion leads to a valid completion,
a repetition of this command will exit.

(minibuffer-complete-and-exit)Fminibuffer-complete-word
Complete the minibuffer contents at most a single word.
After one word is completed as much as possible, a space or hyphen
is added, provided that matches some possible completion.
Return nil if there is no valid completion, else t.

(minibuffer-complete-word)Fdisplay-completion-list
Display the list of completions, COMPLETIONS, using `standard-output'.
Each element may be just a symbol or string
or may be a list of two strings to be printed as if concatenated.
`standard-output' must be a buffer.
The actual completion alternatives, as inserted, are given `mouse-face'
properties of `highlight'.
At the end, this runs the normal hook `completion-setup-hook'.
It can find the completion buffer in `standard-output'.

(display-completion-list COMPLETIONS)Fminibuffer-completion-help
Display a list of possible completions of the current minibuffer contents.

(minibuffer-completion-help)Fself-insert-and-exit
Terminate minibuffer input.

(self-insert-and-exit)Fexit-minibuffer
Terminate this minibuffer argument.

(exit-minibuffer)Fminibuffer-depth
Return current depth of activations of minibuffer, a nonnegative integer.

(minibuffer-depth)Fminibuffer-prompt
Return the prompt string of the currently-active minibuffer.
If no minibuffer is active, return nil.

(minibuffer-prompt)Fminibuffer-message
Temporarily display STRING at the end of the minibuffer.
The text is displayed for two seconds,
or until the next input event arrives, whichever comes first.

(minibuffer-message STRING)Vread-buffer-function
If this is non-nil, `read-buffer' does its work by calling this function.Vminibuffer-setup-hook
Normal hook run just after entry to minibuffer.Vminibuffer-exit-hook
Normal hook run just after exit from minibuffer.Vhistory-length
*Maximum length for history lists before truncation takes place.
A number means that length; t means infinite.  Truncation takes place
just after a new element is inserted.  Setting the history-length
property of a history variable overrides this default.Vcompletion-auto-help
*Non-nil means automatically provide help for invalid completion input.Vcompletion-ignore-case
Non-nil means don't consider case significant in completion.Venable-recursive-minibuffers
*Non-nil means to allow minibuffer commands while in the minibuffer.
This variable makes a difference whenever the minibuffer window is active.Vminibuffer-completion-table
Alist or obarray used for completion in the minibuffer.
This becomes the ALIST argument to `try-completion' and `all-completion'.

The value may alternatively be a function, which is given three arguments:
  STRING, the current buffer contents;
  PREDICATE, the predicate for filtering possible matches;
  CODE, which says what kind of things to do.
CODE can be nil, t or `lambda'.
nil means to return the best completion of STRING, or nil if there is none.
t means to return a list of all possible completions of STRING.
`lambda' means to return t if STRING is a valid completion as it stands.Vminibuffer-completion-predicate
Within call to `completing-read', this holds the PREDICATE argument.Vminibuffer-completion-confirm
Non-nil => demand confirmation of completion before exiting minibuffer.Vminibuffer-completing-file-name
Non-nil means completing file names.Vminibuffer-help-form
Value that `help-form' takes on inside the minibuffer.Vminibuffer-history-variable
History list symbol to add minibuffer values to.
Each string of minibuffer input, as it appears on exit from the minibuffer,
is added with
  (set minibuffer-history-variable
       (cons STRING (symbol-value minibuffer-history-variable)))Vminibuffer-history-position
Current position of redoing in the history list.Vminibuffer-auto-raise
*Non-nil means entering the minibuffer raises the minibuffer's frame.
Some uses of the echo area also raise that frame (since they use it too).Vcompletion-regexp-list
List of regexps that should restrict possible completions.Vminibuffer-allow-text-properties
Non-nil means `read-from-minibuffer' should not discard text properties.
This also affects `read-string', but it does not affect `read-minibuffer',
`read-no-blanks-input', or any of the functions that do minibuffer input
with completion; they always discard text properties.Vminibuffer-prompt-properties
Text properties that are added to minibuffer prompts.
These are in addition to the basic `field' property, and stickiness
properties.Ffind-file-name-handler
Return FILENAME's handler function for OPERATION, if it has one.
Otherwise, return nil.
A file name is handled if one of the regular expressions in
`file-name-handler-alist' matches it.

If OPERATION equals `inhibit-file-name-operation', then we ignore
any handlers that are members of `inhibit-file-name-handlers',
but we still do run any other handlers.  This lets handlers
use the standard functions without calling themselves recursively.

(find-file-name-handler FILENAME OPERATION)Ffile-name-directory
Return the directory component in file name FILENAME.
Return nil if FILENAME does not include a directory.
Otherwise return a directory spec.
Given a Unix syntax file name, returns a string ending in slash;
on VMS, perhaps instead a string ending in `:', `]' or `>'.

(file-name-directory FILENAME)Ffile-name-nondirectory
Return file name FILENAME sans its directory.
For example, in a Unix-syntax file name,
this is everything after the last slash,
or the entire name if it contains no slash.

(file-name-nondirectory FILENAME)Funhandled-file-name-directory
Return a directly usable directory name somehow associated with FILENAME.
A `directly usable' directory name is one that may be used without the
intervention of any file handler.
If FILENAME is a directly usable file itself, return
(file-name-directory FILENAME).
The `call-process' and `start-process' functions use this function to
get a current directory to run processes in.

(unhandled-file-name-directory FILENAME)Ffile-name-as-directory
Return a string representing file FILENAME interpreted as a directory.
This operation exists because a directory is also a file, but its name as
a directory is different from its name as a file.
The result can be used as the value of `default-directory'
or passed as second argument to `expand-file-name'.
For a Unix-syntax file name, just appends a slash.
On VMS, converts "[X]FOO.DIR" to "[X.FOO]", etc.

(file-name-as-directory FILE)Fdirectory-file-name
Returns the file name of the directory named DIRECTORY.
This is the name of the file that holds the data for the directory DIRECTORY.
This operation exists because a directory is also a file, but its name as
a directory is different from its name as a file.
In Unix-syntax, this function just removes the final slash.
On VMS, given a VMS-syntax directory name such as "[X.Y]",
it returns a file name such as "[X]Y.DIR.1".

(directory-file-name DIRECTORY)Fmake-temp-name
Generate temporary file name (string) starting with PREFIX (a string).
The Emacs process number forms part of the result,
so there is no danger of generating a name being used by another process.

In addition, this function makes an attempt to choose a name
which has no existing file.  To make this work,
PREFIX should be an absolute file name.

There is a race condition between calling `make-temp-name' and creating the
file which opens all kinds of security holes.  For that reason, you should
probably use `make-temp-file' instead.

(make-temp-name PREFIX)Fexpand-file-name
Convert filename NAME to absolute, and canonicalize it.
Second arg DEFAULT-DIRECTORY is directory to start with if NAME is relative
 (does not start with slash); if DEFAULT-DIRECTORY is nil or missing,
the current buffer's value of default-directory is used.
File name components that are `.' are removed, and 
so are file name components followed by `..', along with the `..' itself;
note that these simplifications are done without checking the resulting
file names in the file system.
An initial `~/' expands to your home directory.
An initial `~USER/' expands to USER's home directory.
See also the function `substitute-in-file-name'.

(expand-file-name NAME &optional DEFAULT-DIRECTORY)Fsubstitute-in-file-name
Substitute environment variables referred to in FILENAME.
`$FOO' where FOO is an environment variable name means to substitute
the value of that variable.  The variable name should be terminated
with a character not a letter, digit or underscore; otherwise, enclose
the entire variable name in braces.
If `/~' appears, all of FILENAME through that `/' is discarded.

On VMS, `$' substitution is not done; this function does little and only
duplicates what `expand-file-name' does.

(substitute-in-file-name FILENAME)Fcopy-file
Copy FILE to NEWNAME.  Both args must be strings.
Signals a `file-already-exists' error if file NEWNAME already exists,
unless a third argument OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS is supplied and non-nil.
A number as third arg means request confirmation if NEWNAME already exists.
This is what happens in interactive use with M-x.
Fourth arg KEEP-TIME non-nil means give the new file the same
last-modified time as the old one.  (This works on only some systems.)
A prefix arg makes KEEP-TIME non-nil.

(copy-file FILE NEWNAME &optional OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS KEEP-TIME)Fmake-directory-internal
Create a new directory named DIRECTORY.

(make-directory-internal DIRECTORY)Fdelete-directory
Delete the directory named DIRECTORY.

(delete-directory DIRECTORY)Fdelete-file
Delete file named FILENAME.
If file has multiple names, it continues to exist with the other names.

(delete-file FILENAME)Frename-file
Rename FILE as NEWNAME.  Both args strings.
If file has names other than FILE, it continues to have those names.
Signals a `file-already-exists' error if a file NEWNAME already exists
unless optional third argument OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS is non-nil.
A number as third arg means request confirmation if NEWNAME already exists.
This is what happens in interactive use with M-x.

(rename-file FILE NEWNAME &optional OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS)Fadd-name-to-file
Give FILE additional name NEWNAME.  Both args strings.
Signals a `file-already-exists' error if a file NEWNAME already exists
unless optional third argument OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS is non-nil.
A number as third arg means request confirmation if NEWNAME already exists.
This is what happens in interactive use with M-x.

(add-name-to-file FILE NEWNAME &optional OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS)Fmake-symbolic-link
Make a symbolic link to FILENAME, named LINKNAME.  Both args strings.
Signals a `file-already-exists' error if a file LINKNAME already exists
unless optional third argument OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS is non-nil.
A number as third arg means request confirmation if LINKNAME already exists.
This happens for interactive use with M-x.

(make-symbolic-link FILENAME LINKNAME &optional OK-IF-ALREADY-EXISTS)Fdefine-logical-name
Define the job-wide logical name NAME to have the value STRING.
If STRING is nil or a null string, the logical name NAME is deleted.

(define-logical-name NAME STRING)Fsysnetunam
Open a network connection to PATH using LOGIN as the login string.

(sysnetunam PATH LOGIN)Ffile-name-absolute-p
Return t if file FILENAME specifies an absolute file name.
On Unix, this is a name starting with a `/' or a `~'.

(file-name-absolute-p FILENAME)Ffile-exists-p
Return t if file FILENAME exists.  (This does not mean you can read it.)
See also `file-readable-p' and `file-attributes'.

(file-exists-p FILENAME)Ffile-executable-p
Return t if FILENAME can be executed by you.
For a directory, this means you can access files in that directory.

(file-executable-p FILENAME)Ffile-readable-p
Return t if file FILENAME exists and you can read it.
See also `file-exists-p' and `file-attributes'.

(file-readable-p FILENAME)Ffile-writable-p
Return t if file FILENAME can be written or created by you.

(file-writable-p FILENAME)Faccess-file
Access file FILENAME, and get an error if that does not work.
The second argument STRING is used in the error message.
If there is no error, we return nil.

(access-file FILENAME STRING)Ffile-symlink-p
Return non-nil if file FILENAME is the name of a symbolic link.
The value is the name of the file to which it is linked.
Otherwise returns nil.

(file-symlink-p FILENAME)Ffile-directory-p
Return t if FILENAME names an existing directory.
Symbolic links to directories count as directories.
See `file-symlink-p' to distinguish symlinks.

(file-directory-p FILENAME)Ffile-accessible-directory-p
Return t if file FILENAME is the name of a directory as a file,
and files in that directory can be opened by you.  In order to use a
directory as a buffer's current directory, this predicate must return true.
A directory name spec may be given instead; then the value is t
if the directory so specified exists and really is a readable and
searchable directory.

(file-accessible-directory-p FILENAME)Ffile-regular-p
Return t if file FILENAME is the name of a regular file.
This is the sort of file that holds an ordinary stream of data bytes.

(file-regular-p FILENAME)Ffile-modes
Return mode bits of file named FILENAME, as an integer.

(file-modes FILENAME)Fset-file-modes
Set mode bits of file named FILENAME to MODE (an integer).
Only the 12 low bits of MODE are used.

(set-file-modes FILENAME MODE)Fset-default-file-modes
Set the file permission bits for newly created files.
The argument MODE should be an integer; only the low 9 bits are used.
This setting is inherited by subprocesses.

(set-default-file-modes MODE)Fdefault-file-modes
Return the default file protection for created files.
The value is an integer.

(default-file-modes)Funix-sync
Tell Unix to finish all pending disk updates.

(unix-sync)Ffile-newer-than-file-p
Return t if file FILE1 is newer than file FILE2.
If FILE1 does not exist, the answer is nil;
otherwise, if FILE2 does not exist, the answer is t.

(file-newer-than-file-p FILE1 FILE2)Finsert-file-contents
Insert contents of file FILENAME after point.
Returns list of absolute file name and number of bytes inserted.
If second argument VISIT is non-nil, the buffer's visited filename
and last save file modtime are set, and it is marked unmodified.
If visiting and the file does not exist, visiting is completed
before the error is signaled.
The optional third and fourth arguments BEG and END
specify what portion of the file to insert.
These arguments count bytes in the file, not characters in the buffer.
If VISIT is non-nil, BEG and END must be nil.

If optional fifth argument REPLACE is non-nil,
it means replace the current buffer contents (in the accessible portion)
with the file contents.  This is better than simply deleting and inserting
the whole thing because (1) it preserves some marker positions
and (2) it puts less data in the undo list.
When REPLACE is non-nil, the value is the number of characters actually read,
which is often less than the number of characters to be read.

This does code conversion according to the value of
`coding-system-for-read' or `file-coding-system-alist',
and sets the variable `last-coding-system-used' to the coding system
actually used.

(insert-file-contents FILENAME &optional VISIT BEG END REPLACE)Fwrite-region
Write current region into specified file.
When called from a program, takes three arguments:
START, END and FILENAME.  START and END are buffer positions.
Optional fourth argument APPEND if non-nil means
  append to existing file contents (if any).  If it is an integer,
  seek to that offset in the file before writing.
Optional fifth argument VISIT if t means
  set the last-save-file-modtime of buffer to this file's modtime
  and mark buffer not modified.
If VISIT is a string, it is a second file name;
  the output goes to FILENAME, but the buffer is marked as visiting VISIT.
  VISIT is also the file name to lock and unlock for clash detection.
If VISIT is neither t nor nil nor a string,
  that means do not print the "Wrote file" message.
The optional sixth arg LOCKNAME, if non-nil, specifies the name to
  use for locking and unlocking, overriding FILENAME and VISIT.
The optional seventh arg MUSTBENEW, if non-nil, insists on a check
  for an existing file with the same name.  If MUSTBENEW is `excl',
  that means to get an error if the file already exists; never overwrite.
  If MUSTBENEW is neither nil nor `excl', that means ask for
  confirmation before overwriting, but do go ahead and overwrite the file
  if the user confirms.
Kludgy feature: if START is a string, then that string is written
to the file, instead of any buffer contents, and END is ignored.

This does code conversion according to the value of
`coding-system-for-write', `buffer-file-coding-system', or
`file-coding-system-alist', and sets the variable
`last-coding-system-used' to the coding system actually used.

(write-region START END FILENAME &optional APPEND VISIT LOCKNAME MUSTBENEW)Fcar-less-than-car
Return t if (car A) is numerically less than (car B).

(car-less-than-car A B)Fverify-visited-file-modtime
Return t if last mod time of BUF's visited file matches what BUF records.
This means that the file has not been changed since it was visited or saved.

(verify-visited-file-modtime BUF)Fclear-visited-file-modtime
Clear out records of last mod time of visited file.
Next attempt to save will certainly not complain of a discrepancy.

(clear-visited-file-modtime)Fvisited-file-modtime
Return the current buffer's recorded visited file modification time.
The value is a list of the form (HIGH . LOW), like the time values
that `file-attributes' returns.

(visited-file-modtime)Fset-visited-file-modtime
Update buffer's recorded modification time from the visited file's time.
Useful if the buffer was not read from the file normally
or if the file itself has been changed for some known benign reason.
An argument specifies the modification time value to use
(instead of that of the visited file), in the form of a list
(HIGH . LOW) or (HIGH LOW).

(set-visited-file-modtime &optional TIME-LIST)Fdo-auto-save
Auto-save all buffers that need it.
This is all buffers that have auto-saving enabled
and are changed since last auto-saved.
Auto-saving writes the buffer into a file
so that your editing is not lost if the system crashes.
This file is not the file you visited; that changes only when you save.
Normally we run the normal hook `auto-save-hook' before saving.

A non-nil NO-MESSAGE argument means do not print any message if successful.
A non-nil CURRENT-ONLY argument means save only current buffer.

(do-auto-save &optional NO-MESSAGE CURRENT-ONLY)Fset-buffer-auto-saved
Mark current buffer as auto-saved with its current text.
No auto-save file will be written until the buffer changes again.

(set-buffer-auto-saved)Fclear-buffer-auto-save-failure
Clear any record of a recent auto-save failure in the current buffer.

(clear-buffer-auto-save-failure)Frecent-auto-save-p
Return t if buffer has been auto-saved since last read in or saved.

(recent-auto-save-p)Fread-file-name-internal
Internal subroutine for read-file-name.  Do not call this.

(read-file-name-internal STRING DIR ACTION)Fread-file-name
Read file name, prompting with PROMPT and completing in directory DIR.
Value is not expanded---you must call `expand-file-name' yourself.
Default name to DEFAULT-FILENAME if user enters a null string.
 (If DEFAULT-FILENAME is omitted, the visited file name is used,
  except that if INITIAL is specified, that combined with DIR is used.)
Fourth arg MUSTMATCH non-nil means require existing file's name.
 Non-nil and non-t means also require confirmation after completion.
Fifth arg INITIAL specifies text to start with.
DIR defaults to current buffer's directory default.

If this command was invoked with the mouse, use a file dialog box if
`use-dialog-box' is non-nil, and the window system or X toolkit in use
provides a file dialog box..

(read-file-name PROMPT &optional DIR DEFAULT-FILENAME MUSTMATCH INITIAL)Vfile-name-coding-system
*Coding system for encoding file names.
If it is nil, default-file-name-coding-system (which see) is used.Vdefault-file-name-coding-system
Default coding system for encoding file names.
This variable is used only when file-name-coding-system is nil.

This variable is set/changed by the command set-language-environment.
User should not set this variable manually,
instead use file-name-coding-system to get a constant encoding
of file names regardless of the current language environment.Vauto-save-file-format
*Format in which to write auto-save files.
Should be a list of symbols naming formats that are defined in `format-alist'.
If it is t, which is the default, auto-save files are written in the
same format as a regular save would use.Vinsert-default-directory
*Non-nil means when reading a filename start with default dir in minibuffer.Vvms-stmlf-recfm
*Non-nil means write new files with record format `stmlf'.
nil means use format `var'.  This variable is meaningful only on VMS.Vdirectory-sep-char
Directory separator character for built-in functions that return file names.
The value should be either ?/ or ?\ (any other value is treated as ?\).
This variable affects the built-in functions only on Windows,
on other platforms, it is initialized so that Lisp code can find out
what the normal separator is.

WARNING: This variable is deprecated and will be removed in the near
future.  DO NOT USE IT.Vfile-name-handler-alist
*Alist of elements (REGEXP . HANDLER) for file names handled specially.
If a file name matches REGEXP, then all I/O on that file is done by calling
HANDLER.

The first argument given to HANDLER is the name of the I/O primitive
to be handled; the remaining arguments are the arguments that were
passed to that primitive.  For example, if you do
    (file-exists-p FILENAME)
and FILENAME is handled by HANDLER, then HANDLER is called like this:
    (funcall HANDLER 'file-exists-p FILENAME)
The function `find-file-name-handler' checks this list for a handler
for its argument.Vset-auto-coding-function
If non-nil, a function to call to decide a coding system of file.
Two arguments are passed to this function: the file name
and the length of a file contents following the point.
This function should return a coding system to decode the file contents.
It should check the file name against `auto-coding-alist'.
If no coding system is decided, it should check a coding system
specified in the heading lines with the format:
	-*- ... coding: CODING-SYSTEM; ... -*-
or local variable spec of the tailing lines with `coding:' tag.Vafter-insert-file-functions
A list of functions to be called at the end of `insert-file-contents'.
Each is passed one argument, the number of bytes inserted.  It should return
the new byte count, and leave point the same.  If `insert-file-contents' is
intercepted by a handler from `file-name-handler-alist', that handler is
responsible for calling the after-insert-file-functions if appropriate.Vwrite-region-annotate-functions
A list of functions to be called at the start of `write-region'.
Each is passed two arguments, START and END as for `write-region'.
These are usually two numbers but not always; see the documentation
for `write-region'.  The function should return a list of pairs
of the form (POSITION . STRING), consisting of strings to be effectively
inserted at the specified positions of the file being written (1 means to
insert before the first byte written).  The POSITIONs must be sorted into
increasing order.  If there are several functions in the list, the several
lists are merged destructively.Vwrite-region-annotations-so-far
When an annotation function is called, this holds the previous annotations.
These are the annotations made by other annotation functions
that were already called.  See also `write-region-annotate-functions'.Vinhibit-file-name-handlers
A list of file name handlers that temporarily should not be used.
This applies only to the operation `inhibit-file-name-operation'.Vinhibit-file-name-operation
The operation for which `inhibit-file-name-handlers' is applicable.Vauto-save-list-file-name
File name in which we write a list of all auto save file names.
This variable is initialized automatically from `auto-save-list-file-prefix'
shortly after Emacs reads your `.emacs' file, if you have not yet given it
a non-nil value.Fdirectory-files
Return a list of names of files in DIRECTORY.
There are three optional arguments:
If FULL is non-nil, return absolute file names.  Otherwise return names
 that are relative to the specified directory.
If MATCH is non-nil, mention only file names that match the regexp MATCH.
If NOSORT is non-nil, the list is not sorted--its order is unpredictable.
 NOSORT is useful if you plan to sort the result yourself.

(directory-files DIRECTORY &optional FULL MATCH NOSORT)Fdirectory-files-and-attributes
Return a list of names of files and their attributes in DIRECTORY.
There are three optional arguments:
If FULL is non-nil, return absolute file names.  Otherwise return names
 that are relative to the specified directory.
If MATCH is non-nil, mention only file names that match the regexp MATCH.
If NOSORT is non-nil, the list is not sorted--its order is unpredictable.
 NOSORT is useful if you plan to sort the result yourself.

(directory-files-and-attributes DIRECTORY &optional FULL MATCH NOSORT)Ffile-name-completion
Complete file name FILE in directory DIRECTORY.
Returns the longest string
common to all file names in DIRECTORY that start with FILE.
If there is only one and FILE matches it exactly, returns t.
Returns nil if DIR contains no name starting with FILE.

(file-name-completion FILE DIRECTORY)Ffile-name-all-completions
Return a list of all completions of file name FILE in directory DIRECTORY.
These are all file names in directory DIRECTORY which begin with FILE.

(file-name-all-completions FILE DIRECTORY)Ffile-name-all-versions
Return a list of all versions of file name FILE in directory DIRECTORY.

(file-name-all-versions FILE DIRECTORY)Ffile-version-limit
Return the maximum number of versions allowed for FILE.
Returns nil if the file cannot be opened or if there is no version limit.

(file-version-limit FILENAME)Ffile-attributes
Return a list of attributes of file FILENAME.
Value is nil if specified file cannot be opened.
Otherwise, list elements are:
 0. t for directory, string (name linked to) for symbolic link, or nil.
 1. Number of links to file.
 2. File uid.
 3. File gid.
 4. Last access time, as a list of two integers.
  First integer has high-order 16 bits of time, second has low 16 bits.
 5. Last modification time, likewise.
 6. Last status change time, likewise.
 7. Size in bytes.
  This is a floating point number if the size is too large for an integer.
 8. File modes, as a string of ten letters or dashes as in ls -l.
 9. t iff file's gid would change if file were deleted and recreated.
10. inode number.  If inode number is larger than the Emacs integer,
  this is a cons cell containing two integers: first the high part,
  then the low 16 bits.
11. Device number.  If it is larger than the Emacs integer, this is
  a cons cell, similar to the inode number.

If file does not exist, returns nil.

(file-attributes FILENAME)Ffile-attributes-lessp
Return t if first arg file attributes list is less than second.
Comparison is in lexicographic order and case is significant.

(file-attributes-lessp F1 F2)Vcompletion-ignored-extensions
*Completion ignores filenames ending in any string in this list.
This variable does not affect lists of possible completions,
but does affect the commands that actually do completions.Fforward-point
Return buffer position N characters after (before if N negative) point.

(forward-point N)Fforward-char
Move point right N characters (left if N is negative).
On reaching end of buffer, stop and signal error.

(forward-char &optional N)Fbackward-char
Move point left N characters (right if N is negative).
On attempt to pass beginning or end of buffer, stop and signal error.

(backward-char &optional N)Fforward-line
Move N lines forward (backward if N is negative).
Precisely, if point is on line I, move to the start of line I + N.
If there isn't room, go as far as possible (no error).
Returns the count of lines left to move.  If moving forward,
that is N - number of lines moved; if backward, N + number moved.
With positive N, a non-empty line at the end counts as one line
  successfully moved (for the return value).

(forward-line &optional N)Fbeginning-of-line
Move point to beginning of current line.
With argument N not nil or 1, move forward N - 1 lines first.
If point reaches the beginning or end of buffer, it stops there.

This command does not move point across a field boundary unless doing so
would move beyond there to a different line; If N is nil or 1, and point
starts at a field boundary, point does not move.  To ignore field
boundaries, either bind `inhibit-field-text-motion' to t, or use the
`forward-line' function instead.  For instance, `(forward-line 0)' does
the same thing as `(beginning-of-line)', except that it ignores field
boundaries.

(beginning-of-line &optional N)Fend-of-line
Move point to end of current line.
With argument N not nil or 1, move forward N - 1 lines first.
If point reaches the beginning or end of buffer, it stops there.

This command does not move point across a field boundary unless doing so
would move beyond there to a different line; if N is nil or 1, and
point starts at a field boundary, point does not move.  To ignore field
boundaries bind `inhibit-field-text-motion' to t.

(end-of-line &optional N)Fdelete-char
Delete the following N characters (previous if N is negative).
Optional second arg KILLFLAG non-nil means kill instead (save in kill ring).
Interactively, N is the prefix arg, and KILLFLAG is set if
N was explicitly specified.

(delete-char N &optional KILLFLAG)Fdelete-backward-char
Delete the previous N characters (following if N is negative).
Optional second arg KILLFLAG non-nil means kill instead (save in kill ring).
Interactively, N is the prefix arg, and KILLFLAG is set if
N was explicitly specified.

(delete-backward-char N &optional KILLFLAG)Fself-insert-command
Insert the character you type.
Whichever character you type to run this command is inserted.

(self-insert-command N)Vself-insert-face
If non-nil, set the face of the next self-inserting character to this.
See also `self-insert-face-command'.Vself-insert-face-command
This is the command that set up `self-insert-face'.
If `last-command' does not equal this value, we ignore `self-insert-face'.Vblink-paren-function
Function called, if non-nil, whenever a close parenthesis is inserted.
More precisely, a char with closeparen syntax is self-inserted.Fcase-table-p
Return t iff OBJECT is a case table.
See `set-case-table' for more information on these data structures.

(case-table-p OBJECT)Fcurrent-case-table
Return the case table of the current buffer.

(current-case-table)Fstandard-case-table
Return the standard case table.
This is the one used for new buffers.

(standard-case-table)Fset-case-table
Select a new case table for the current buffer.
A case table is a char-table which maps characters
to their lower-case equivalents.  It also has three "extra" slots
which may be additional char-tables or nil.
These slots are called UPCASE, CANONICALIZE and EQUIVALENCES.
UPCASE maps each character to its upper-case equivalent;
 if lower and upper case characters are in 1-1 correspondence,
 you may use nil and the upcase table will be deduced from DOWNCASE.
CANONICALIZE maps each character to a canonical equivalent;
 any two characters that are related by case-conversion have the same
 canonical equivalent character; it may be nil, in which case it is
 deduced from DOWNCASE and UPCASE.
EQUIVALENCES is a map that cyclicly permutes each equivalence class
 (of characters with the same canonical equivalent); it may be nil,
 in which case it is deduced from CANONICALIZE.

(set-case-table TABLE)Fset-standard-case-table
Select a new standard case table for new buffers.
See `set-case-table' for more info on case tables.

(set-standard-case-table TABLE)Fupcase
Convert argument to upper case and return that.
The argument may be a character or string.  The result has the same type.
The argument object is not altered--the value is a copy.
See also `capitalize', `downcase' and `upcase-initials'.

(upcase OBJ)Fdowncase
Convert argument to lower case and return that.
The argument may be a character or string.  The result has the same type.
The argument object is not altered--the value is a copy.

(downcase OBJ)Fcapitalize
Convert argument to capitalized form and return that.
This means that each word's first character is upper case
and the rest is lower case.
The argument may be a character or string.  The result has the same type.
The argument object is not altered--the value is a copy.

(capitalize OBJ)Fupcase-initials
Convert the initial of each word in the argument to upper case.
Do not change the other letters of each word.
The argument may be a character or string.  The result has the same type.
The argument object is not altered--the value is a copy.

(upcase-initials OBJ)Fupcase-region
Convert the region to upper case.  In programs, wants two arguments.
These arguments specify the starting and ending character numbers of
the region to operate on.  When used as a command, the text between
point and the mark is operated on.
See also `capitalize-region'.

(upcase-region BEG END)Fdowncase-region
Convert the region to lower case.  In programs, wants two arguments.
These arguments specify the starting and ending character numbers of
the region to operate on.  When used as a command, the text between
point and the mark is operated on.

(downcase-region BEG END)Fcapitalize-region
Convert the region to capitalized form.
Capitalized form means each word's first character is upper case
and the rest of it is lower case.
In programs, give two arguments, the starting and ending
character positions to operate on.

(capitalize-region BEG END)Fupcase-initials-region
Upcase the initial of each word in the region.
Subsequent letters of each word are not changed.
In programs, give two arguments, the starting and ending
character positions to operate on.

(upcase-initials-region BEG END)Fupcase-word
Convert following word (or ARG words) to upper case, moving over.
With negative argument, convert previous words but do not move.
See also `capitalize-word'.

(upcase-word ARG)Fdowncase-word
Convert following word (or ARG words) to lower case, moving over.
With negative argument, convert previous words but do not move.

(downcase-word ARG)Fcapitalize-word
Capitalize the following word (or ARG words), moving over.
This gives the word(s) a first character in upper case
and the rest lower case.
With negative argument, capitalize previous words but do not move.

(capitalize-word ARG)Fcurrent-column
Return the horizontal position of point.  Beginning of line is column 0.
This is calculated by adding together the widths of all the displayed
representations of the character between the start of the previous line
and point.  (eg control characters will have a width of 2 or 4, tabs
will have a variable width)
Ignores finite width of frame, which means that this function may return
values greater than (frame-width).
Whether the line is visible (if `selective-display' is t) has no effect;
however, ^M is treated as end of line when `selective-display' is t.

(current-column)Findent-to
Indent from point with tabs and spaces until COLUMN is reached.
Optional second argument MININUM says always do at least MININUM spaces
even if that goes past COLUMN; by default, MININUM is zero.

(indent-to COLUMN &optional MINIMUM)Fcurrent-indentation
Return the indentation of the current line.
This is the horizontal position of the character
following any initial whitespace.

(current-indentation)Fmove-to-column
Move point to column COLUMN in the current line.
The column of a character is calculated by adding together the widths
as displayed of the previous characters in the line.
This function ignores line-continuation;
there is no upper limit on the column number a character can have
and horizontal scrolling has no effect.

If specified column is within a character, point goes after that character.
If it's past end of line, point goes to end of line.

A non-nil second (optional) argument FORCE means,
if COLUMN is in the middle of a tab character, change it to spaces.
In addition, if FORCE is t, and the line is too short
to reach column COLUMN, add spaces/tabs to get there.

The return value is the current column.

(move-to-column COLUMN &optional FORCE)Fcompute-motion
Scan through the current buffer, calculating screen position.
Scan the current buffer forward from offset FROM,
assuming it is at position FROMPOS--a cons of the form (HPOS . VPOS)--
to position TO or position TOPOS--another cons of the form (HPOS . VPOS)--
and return the ending buffer position and screen location.

There are three additional arguments:

WIDTH is the number of columns available to display text;
this affects handling of continuation lines.
This is usually the value returned by `window-width', less one (to allow
for the continuation glyph).

OFFSETS is either nil or a cons cell (HSCROLL . TAB-OFFSET).
HSCROLL is the number of columns not being displayed at the left
margin; this is usually taken from a window's hscroll member.
TAB-OFFSET is the number of columns of the first tab that aren't
being displayed, perhaps because the line was continued within it.
If OFFSETS is nil, HSCROLL and TAB-OFFSET are assumed to be zero.

WINDOW is the window to operate on.  It is used to choose the display table;
if it is showing the current buffer, it is used also for
deciding which overlay properties apply.
Note that `compute-motion' always operates on the current buffer.

The value is a list of five elements:
  (POS HPOS VPOS PREVHPOS CONTIN)
POS is the buffer position where the scan stopped.
VPOS is the vertical position where the scan stopped.
HPOS is the horizontal position where the scan stopped.

PREVHPOS is the horizontal position one character back from POS.
CONTIN is t if a line was continued after (or within) the previous character.

For example, to find the buffer position of column COL of line LINE
of a certain window, pass the window's starting location as FROM
and the window's upper-left coordinates as FROMPOS.
Pass the buffer's (point-max) as TO, to limit the scan to the end of the
visible section of the buffer, and pass LINE and COL as TOPOS.

(compute-motion FROM FROMPOS TO TOPOS WIDTH OFFSETS WINDOW)Fvertical-motion
Move point to start of the screen line LINES lines down.
If LINES is negative, this means moving up.

This function is an ordinary cursor motion function
which calculates the new position based on how text would be displayed.
The new position may be the start of a line,
or just the start of a continuation line.
The function returns number of screen lines moved over;
that usually equals LINES, but may be closer to zero
if beginning or end of buffer was reached.

The optional second argument WINDOW specifies the window to use for
parameters such as width, horizontal scrolling, and so on.
The default is to use the selected window's parameters.

`vertical-motion' always uses the current buffer,
regardless of which buffer is displayed in WINDOW.
This is consistent with other cursor motion functions
and makes it possible to use `vertical-motion' in any buffer,
whether or not it is currently displayed in some window.

(vertical-motion LINES &optional WINDOW)Vindent-tabs-mode
*Indentation can insert tabs if this is non-nil.
Setting this variable automatically makes it local to the current buffer.Flooking-at
Return t if text after point matches regular expression REGEXP.
This function modifies the match data that `match-beginning',
`match-end' and `match-data' access; save and restore the match
data if you want to preserve them.

(looking-at REGEXP)Fposix-looking-at
Return t if text after point matches regular expression REGEXP.
Find the longest match, in accord with Posix regular expression rules.
This function modifies the match data that `match-beginning',
`match-end' and `match-data' access; save and restore the match
data if you want to preserve them.

(posix-looking-at REGEXP)Fstring-match
Return index of start of first match for REGEXP in STRING, or nil.
Case is ignored if `case-fold-search' is non-nil in the current buffer.
If third arg START is non-nil, start search at that index in STRING.
For index of first char beyond the match, do (match-end 0).
`match-end' and `match-beginning' also give indices of substrings
matched by parenthesis constructs in the pattern.

(string-match REGEXP STRING &optional START)Fposix-string-match
Return index of start of first match for REGEXP in STRING, or nil.
Find the longest match, in accord with Posix regular expression rules.
Case is ignored if `case-fold-search' is non-nil in the current buffer.
If third arg START is non-nil, start search at that index in STRING.
For index of first char beyond the match, do (match-end 0).
`match-end' and `match-beginning' also give indices of substrings
matched by parenthesis constructs in the pattern.

(posix-string-match REGEXP STRING &optional START)Fsearch-backward
Search backward from point for STRING.
Set point to the beginning of the occurrence found, and return point.
An optional second argument bounds the search; it is a buffer position.
The match found must not extend before that position.
Optional third argument, if t, means if fail just return nil (no error).
 If not nil and not t, position at limit of search and return nil.
Optional fourth argument is repeat count--search for successive occurrences.

Search case-sensitivity is determined by the value of the variable
`case-fold-search', which see.

See also the functions `match-beginning', `match-end' and `replace-match'.

(search-backward STRING &optional BOUND NOERROR COUNT)Fsearch-forward
Search forward from point for STRING.
Set point to the end of the occurrence found, and return point.

  to (point-max).
Optional third argument, if t, means if fail just return nil (no error).
  If not nil and not t, move to limit of search and return nil.
Optional fourth argument is repeat count--search for successive occurrences.

Search case-sensitivity is determined by the value of the variable
`case-fold-search', which see.

See also the functions `match-beginning', `match-end' and `replace-match'.

Set point to the beginning of the match, and return point.
The match found is the one starting last in the buffer
and yet ending before the origin of the search.
An optional second argument bounds the search; it is a buffer position.
The match found must start at or after that position.
Optional third argument, if t, means if fail just return nil (no error).
  If not nil and not t, move to limit of search and return nil.
Optional fourth argument is repeat count--search for successive occurrences.
See also the functions `match-beginning', `match-end', `match-string',
and `replace-match'.

(re-search-backward REGEXP &optional BOUND NOERROR COUNT)Fre-search-forward

(posix-search-backward REGEXP &optional BOUND NOERROR COUNT)Fposix-search-forward
Search forward from point for regular expression REGEXP.
Find the longest match in accord with Posix regular expression rules.
Set point to the end of the occurrence found, and return point.
An optional second argument bounds the search; it is a buffer position.
The match found must not extend after that position.

  If not nil and not t, move to limit of search and return nil.
Optional fourth argument is repeat count--search for successive occurrences.
See also the functions `match-beginning', `match-end', `match-string',
and `replace-match'.

(posix-search-forward REGEXP &optional BOUND NOERROR COUNT)Freplace-match
Replace text matched by last search with NEWTEXT.
If second arg FIXEDCASE is non-nil, do not alter case of replacement text.
Otherwise maybe capitalize the whole text, or maybe just word initials,
based on the replaced text.
If the replaced text has only capital letters
and has at least one multiletter word, convert NEWTEXT to all caps.
If the replaced text has at least one word starting with a capital letter,
then capitalize each word in NEWTEXT.

If third arg LITERAL is non-nil, insert NEWTEXT literally.
Otherwise treat `\' as special:
  `\&' in NEWTEXT means substitute original matched text.
  `\N' means substitute what matched the Nth `\(...\)'.
       If Nth parens didn't match, substitute nothing.
  `\\' means insert one `\'.
FIXEDCASE and LITERAL are optional arguments.
Leaves point at end of replacement text.

The optional fourth argument STRING can be a string to modify.
This is meaningful when the previous match was done against STRING,
using `string-match'.  When used this way, `replace-match'
creates and returns a new string made by copying STRING and replacing
the part of STRING that was matched.

The optional fifth argument SUBEXP specifies a subexpression;
it says to replace just that subexpression with NEWTEXT,
rather than replacing the entire matched text.
This is, in a vague sense, the inverse of using `\N' in NEWTEXT;
`\N' copies subexp N into NEWTEXT, but using N as SUBEXP puts
NEWTEXT in place of subexp N.
This is useful only after a regular expression search or match,
since only regular expressions have distinguished subexpressions.

(replace-match NEWTEXT &optional FIXEDCASE LITERAL STRING SUBEXP)Fmatch-beginning
Return position of start of text matched by last search.
SUBEXP, a number, specifies which parenthesized expression in the last
  regexp.
Value is nil if SUBEXPth pair didn't match, or there were less than
  SUBEXP pairs.
Zero means the entire text matched by the whole regexp or whole string.

(match-beginning SUBEXP)Fmatch-end
Return position of end of text matched by last search.
SUBEXP, a number, specifies which parenthesized expression in the last
  regexp.
Value is nil if SUBEXPth pair didn't match, or there were less than
  SUBEXP pairs.
Zero means the entire text matched by the whole regexp or whole string.

(match-end SUBEXP)Fmatch-data
Return a list containing all info on what the last search matched.
Element 2N is `(match-beginning N)'; element 2N + 1 is `(match-end N)'.
All the elements are markers or nil (nil if the Nth pair didn't match)
if the last match was on a buffer; integers or nil if a string was matched.
Use `store-match-data' to reinstate the data in this list.

If INTEGERS (the optional first argument) is non-nil, always use integers
(rather than markers) to represent buffer positions.
If REUSE is a list, reuse it as part of the value.  If REUSE is long enough
to hold all the values, and if INTEGERS is non-nil, no consing is done.

(match-data &optional INTEGERS REUSE)Fset-match-data
Set internal data on last search match from elements of LIST.
LIST should have been created by calling `match-data' previously.

(set-match-data LIST)Fregexp-quote
Return a regexp string which matches exactly STRING and nothing else.

(regexp-quote STRING)Fundo-boundary
Mark a boundary between units of undo.

Undo N records from the front of the list LIST.
Return what remains of the list.

(primitive-undo N LIST)Fmake-string
Return a newly created string of length LENGTH, with each element being INIT.
Both LENGTH and INIT must be numbers.

(make-string LENGTH INIT)Fmake-bool-vector
Return a new bool-vector of length LENGTH, using INIT for as each element.
LENGTH must be a number.  INIT matters only in whether it is t or nil.

(make-bool-vector LENGTH INIT)Fcons
Create a new cons, give it CAR and CDR as components, and return it.

(cons CAR CDR)Flist
Return a newly created list with specified arguments as elements.
Any number of arguments, even zero arguments, are allowed.Fmake-list
Return a newly created list of length LENGTH, with each element being INIT.

(make-list LENGTH INIT)Fmake-vector
Return a newly created vector of length LENGTH, with each element being INIT.
See also the function `vector'.

(make-vector LENGTH INIT)Fmake-char-table
Return a newly created char-table, with purpose PURPOSE.
Each element is initialized to INIT, which defaults to nil.
PURPOSE should be a symbol which has a `char-table-extra-slots' property.
The property's value should be an integer between 0 and 10.

(make-char-table PURPOSE &optional INIT)Fvector
Return a newly created vector with specified arguments as elements.
Any number of arguments, even zero arguments, are allowed.Fmake-byte-code
Create a byte-code object with specified arguments as elements.
The arguments should be the arglist, bytecode-string, constant vector,
stack size, (optional) doc string, and (optional) interactive spec.
The first four arguments are required; at most six have any
significance.Fmake-symbol
Return a newly allocated uninterned symbol whose name is NAME.
Its value and function definition are void, and its property list is nil.

(make-symbol NAME)Fmake-marker
Return a newly allocated marker which does not point at any place.

(make-marker)Fgc-status
Show information about live and zombie objects.

(gc-status)Fpurecopy
Make a copy of OBJECT in pure storage.
Recursively copies contents of vectors and cons cells.
Does not copy symbols.  Copies strings without text properties.

(purecopy OBJ)Fgarbage-collect
Reclaim storage for Lisp objects no longer needed.
Returns info on amount of space in use:
 ((USED-CONSES . FREE-CONSES) (USED-SYMS . FREE-SYMS)
  (USED-MARKERS . FREE-MARKERS) USED-STRING-CHARS USED-VECTOR-SLOTS
  (USED-FLOATS . FREE-FLOATS) (USED-INTERVALS . FREE-INTERVALS)
  (USED-STRINGS . FREE-STRINGS))
Garbage collection happens automatically if you cons more than
`gc-cons-threshold' bytes of Lisp data since previous garbage collection.

(garbage-collect)Fmemory-limit
Return the address of the last byte Emacs has allocated, divided by 1024.
This may be helpful in debugging Emacs's memory usage.
We divide the value by 1024 to make sure it fits in a Lisp integer.

(memory-limit)Fmemory-use-counts
Return a list of counters that measure how much consing there has been.
Each of these counters increments for a certain kind of object.
The counters wrap around from the largest positive integer to zero.
Garbage collection does not decrease them.
The elements of the value are as follows:
  (CONSES FLOATS VECTOR-CELLS SYMBOLS STRING-CHARS MISCS INTERVALS STRINGS)
All are in units of 1 = one object consed
except for VECTOR-CELLS and STRING-CHARS, which count the total length of
objects consed.
MISCS include overlays, markers, and some internal types.
Frames, windows, buffers, and subprocesses count as vectors
  (but the contents of a buffer's text do not count here).

(memory-use-counts)Vgc-cons-threshold
*Number of bytes of consing between garbage collections.
Garbage collection can happen automatically once this many bytes have been
allocated since the last garbage collection.  All data types count.

Garbage collection happens automatically only when `eval' is called.

By binding this temporarily to a large number, you can effectively
prevent garbage collection during a part of the program.Vpure-bytes-used
Number of bytes of sharable Lisp data allocated so far.Vcons-cells-consed
Number of cons cells that have been consed so far.Vfloats-consed
Number of floats that have been consed so far.Vvector-cells-consed

Number of string characters that have been consed so far.Vmisc-objects-consed
Number of miscellaneous objects that have been consed so far.Vintervals-consed
Number of intervals that have been consed so far.Vstrings-consed
Number of strings that have been consed so far.Vpurify-flag
Non-nil means loading Lisp code in order to dump an executable.
This means that certain objects should be allocated in shared (pure) space.Vundo-limit
Keep no more undo information once it exceeds this size.
This limit is applied when garbage collection happens.
The size is counted as the number of bytes occupied,
which includes both saved text and other data.Vundo-strong-limit
Don't keep more than this much size of undo information.
A command which pushes past this size is itself forgotten.
This limit is applied when garbage collection happens.
The size is counted as the number of bytes occupied,
which includes both saved text and other data.Vgarbage-collection-messages
Non-nil means display messages at start and end of garbage collection.Feq
Return t if the two args are the same Lisp object.

(eq OBJ1 OBJ2)Fnull
Return t if OBJECT is nil.

(null OBJECT)Ftype-of

(setplist SYMBOL NEWPLIST)Fsubr-arity
Return minimum and maximum number of args allowed for SUBR.
SUBR must be a built-in function.
The returned value is a pair (MIN . MAX).  MIN is the minimum number
of args.  MAX is the maximum number or the symbol `many', for a
function with `&rest' args, or `unevalled' for a special form.

(subr-arity SUBR)Fsubr-interactive-form
Return the interactive form of SUBR or nil if none.
SUBR must be a built-in function.  Value, if non-nil, is a list
(interactive SPEC).

(subr-interactive-form SUBR)Fsymbol-value
Return SYMBOL's value.  Error if that is void.

(symbol-value SYMBOL)Fset
Set SYMBOL's value to NEWVAL, and return NEWVAL.

(set SYMBOL NEWVAL)Fdefault-boundp
Return t if SYMBOL has a non-void default value.
This is the value that is seen in buffers that do not have their own values
for this variable.

(default-boundp SYMBOL)Fdefault-value
Return SYMBOL's default value.
This is the value that is seen in buffers that do not have their own values
for this variable.  The default value is meaningful for variables with
local bindings in certain buffers.

(default-value SYMBOL)Fset-default
Set SYMBOL's default value to VAL.  SYMBOL and VAL are evaluated.
The default value is seen in buffers that do not have their own values
for this variable.

(set-default SYMBOL VALUE)Fsetq-default
Set the default value of variable VAR to VALUE.
VAR, the variable name, is literal (not evaluated);
VALUE is an expression and it is evaluated.
The default value of a variable is seen in buffers
that do not have their own values for the variable.

More generally, you can use multiple variables and values, as in
  (setq-default SYMBOL VALUE SYMBOL VALUE...)
This sets each SYMBOL's default value to the corresponding VALUE.
The VALUE for the Nth SYMBOL can refer to the new default values
of previous SYMs.Fmake-variable-buffer-local
Make VARIABLE become buffer-local whenever it is set.
At any time, the value for the current buffer is in effect,
unless the variable has never been set in this buffer,
in which case the default value is in effect.
Note that binding the variable with `let', or setting it while
a `let'-style binding made in this buffer is in effect,
does not make the variable buffer-local.

The function `default-value' gets the default value and `set-default' sets it.

(make-variable-buffer-local VARIABLE)Fmake-local-variable
Make VARIABLE have a separate value in the current buffer.
Other buffers will continue to share a common default value.
(The buffer-local value of VARIABLE starts out as the same value
VARIABLE previously had.  If VARIABLE was void, it remains void.)
See also `make-variable-buffer-local'.

If the variable is already arranged to become local when set,
this function causes a local value to exist for this buffer,
just as setting the variable would do.

This function returns VARIABLE, and therefore
  (set (make-local-variable 'VARIABLE) VALUE-EXP)
works.

Do not use `make-local-variable' to make a hook variable buffer-local.
Instead, use `add-hook' and specify t for the LOCAL argument.

(make-local-variable VARIABLE)Fkill-local-variable
Make VARIABLE no longer have a separate value in the current buffer.
From now on the default value will apply in this buffer.

(kill-local-variable VARIABLE)Fmake-variable-frame-local
Enable VARIABLE to have frame-local bindings.
When a frame-local binding exists in the current frame,
it is in effect whenever the current buffer has no buffer-local binding.
A frame-local binding is actual a frame parameter value;
thus, any given frame has a local binding for VARIABLE
if it has a value for the frame parameter named VARIABLE.
See `modify-frame-parameters'.

(make-variable-frame-local VARIABLE)Flocal-variable-p
Non-nil if VARIABLE has a local binding in buffer BUFFER.
BUFFER defaults to the current buffer.

(local-variable-p VARIABLE &optional BUFFER)Flocal-variable-if-set-p
Non-nil if VARIABLE will be local in buffer BUFFER if it is set there.
BUFFER defaults to the current buffer.

(local-variable-if-set-p VARIABLE &optional BUFFER)Findirect-function
Return the function at the end of OBJECT's function chain.
If OBJECT is a symbol, follow all function indirections and return the final
function binding.
If OBJECT is not a symbol, just return it.
Signal a void-function error if the final symbol is unbound.
Signal a cyclic-function-indirection error if there is a loop in the
function chain of symbols.

(indirect-function OBJECT)Faref

Return t if NUMBER is zero.

(zerop NUMBER)Fnumber-to-string
Convert NUMBER to a string by printing it in decimal.
Uses a minus sign if negative.
NUMBER may be an integer or a floating point number.

(number-to-string NUMBER)Fstring-to-number
Convert STRING to a number by parsing it as a decimal number.
This parses both integers and floating point numbers.
It ignores leading spaces and tabs.

If BASE, interpret STRING as a number in that base.  If BASE isn't
present, base 10 is used.  BASE must be between 2 and 16 (inclusive).
If the base used is not 10, floating point is not recognized.

(string-to-number STRING &optional BASE)F+
Return sum of any number of arguments, which are numbers or markers.F-
Negate number or subtract numbers or markers.
With one arg, negates it.  With more than one arg,
subtracts all but the first from the first.F*
Returns product of any number of arguments, which are numbers or markers.F/
Returns first argument divided by all the remaining arguments.
The arguments must be numbers or markers.F%

If COUNT is negative, shifting is actually to the right.
In this case, the sign bit is duplicated.

(ash VALUE COUNT)Flsh
Return VALUE with its bits shifted left by COUNT.
If COUNT is negative, shifting is actually to the right.
In this case,  zeros are shifted in on the left.

(lsh VALUE COUNT)F1+
Return NUMBER plus one.  NUMBER may be a number or a marker.
Markers are converted to integers.

(1+ NUMBER)F1-
Return NUMBER minus one.  NUMBER may be a number or a marker.
Markers are converted to integers.

(1- NUMBER)Flognot
Return the bitwise complement of NUMBER.  NUMBER must be an integer.

(lognot NUMBER)Fdocumentation
Return the documentation string of FUNCTION.
Unless a non-nil second argument RAW is given, the
string is passed through `substitute-command-keys'.

(documentation FUNCTION &optional RAW)Fdocumentation-property
Return the documentation string that is SYMBOL's PROP property.
Third argument RAW omitted or nil means pass the result through
`substitute-command-keys' if it is a string.

This is differs from `get' in that it can refer to strings stored in the
`etc/DOC' file; and that it evaluates documentation properties that
aren't strings.

(documentation-property SYMBOL PROP &optional RAW)FSnarf-documentation
Used during Emacs initialization, before dumping runnable Emacs,
to find pointers to doc strings stored in `etc/DOC...' and
record them in function definitions.
One arg, FILENAME, a string which does not include a directory.
The file is found in `../etc' now; found in the `data-directory'
when doc strings are referred to later in the dumped Emacs.

(Snarf-documentation FILENAME)Fsubstitute-command-keys
Substitute key descriptions for command names in STRING.
Return a new string which is STRING with substrings of the form \=\[COMMAND]
replaced by either:  a keystroke sequence that will invoke COMMAND,
or "M-x COMMAND" if COMMAND is not on any keys.
Substrings of the form \=\{MAPVAR} are replaced by summaries
(made by describe-bindings) of the value of MAPVAR, taken as a keymap.
Substrings of the form \=\<MAPVAR> specify to use the value of MAPVAR
as the keymap for future \=\[COMMAND] substrings.
\=\= quotes the following character and is discarded;
thus, \=\=\=\= puts \=\= into the output, and \=\=\=\[ puts \=\[ into the output.

(substitute-command-keys STRING)Vinternal-doc-file-name
Name of file containing documentation strings of built-in symbols.Vhelp-manyarg-func-alist
Alist of primitive functions and descriptions of their arg lists.
All special forms and primitives which effectively have &rest args
should have an entry here so that `documentation' can provide their
arg list.Fchar-to-string
Convert arg CHARACTER to a string containing that character.

(char-to-string CHARACTER)Fstring-to-char
Convert arg STRING to a character, the first character of that string.
A multibyte character is handled correctly.

(string-to-char STRING)Fpoint
Return value of point, as an integer.
Beginning of buffer is position (point-min)

(point)Fpoint-marker
Return value of point, as a marker object.

(point-marker)Fgoto-char
Set point to POSITION, a number or marker.
Beginning of buffer is position (point-min), end is (point-max).
If the position is in the middle of a multibyte form,
the actual point is set at the head of the multibyte form
except in the case that `enable-multibyte-characters' is nil.

(goto-char POSITION)Fregion-beginning
Return position of beginning of region, as an integer.

(region-beginning)Fregion-end
Return position of end of region, as an integer.

(region-end)Fmark-marker
Return this buffer's mark, as a marker object.
Watch out!  Moving this marker changes the mark position.
If you set the marker not to point anywhere, the buffer will have no mark.

(mark-marker)Fdelete-field
Delete the field surrounding POS.
A field is a region of text with the same `field' property.
If POS is nil, the value of point is used for POS.

(delete-field &optional POS)Ffield-string
Return the contents of the field surrounding POS as a string.
A field is a region of text with the same `field' property.
If POS is nil, the value of point is used for POS.

(field-string &optional POS)Ffield-string-no-properties
Return the contents of the field around POS, without text-properties.
A field is a region of text with the same `field' property.
If POS is nil, the value of point is used for POS.

(field-string-no-properties &optional POS)Ffield-beginning
Return the beginning of the field surrounding POS.
A field is a region of text with the same `field' property.
If POS is nil, the value of point is used for POS.
If ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE is non-nil and POS is at the beginning of its
field, then the beginning of the *previous* field is returned.

(field-beginning &optional POS ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE)Ffield-end
Return the end of the field surrounding POS.
A field is a region of text with the same `field' property.
If POS is nil, the value of point is used for POS.
If ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE is non-nil and POS is at the end of its field,
then the end of the *following* field is returned.

(field-end &optional POS ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE)Fconstrain-to-field
Return the position closest to NEW-POS that is in the same field as OLD-POS.

A field is a region of text with the same `field' property.
If NEW-POS is nil, then the current point is used instead, and set to the
constrained position if that is different.

If OLD-POS is at the boundary of two fields, then the allowable
positions for NEW-POS depends on the value of the optional argument
ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE: If ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE is nil, then NEW-POS is
constrained to the field that has the same `field' char-property
as any new characters inserted at OLD-POS, whereas if ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE
is non-nil, NEW-POS is constrained to the union of the two adjacent
fields.  Additionally, if two fields are separated by another field with
the special value `boundary', then any point within this special field is
also considered to be `on the boundary'.

If the optional argument ONLY-IN-LINE is non-nil and constraining
NEW-POS would move it to a different line, NEW-POS is returned
unconstrained.  This useful for commands that move by line, like
\[next-line] or \[beginning-of-line], which should generally respect field boundaries
only in the case where they can still move to the right line.

If the optional argument INHIBIT-CAPTURE-PROPERTY is non-nil, and OLD-POS has
a non-nil property of that name, then any field boundaries are ignored.

Field boundaries are not noticed if `inhibit-field-text-motion' is non-nil.

(constrain-to-field NEW-POS OLD-POS &optional ESCAPE-FROM-EDGE ONLY-IN-LINE INHIBIT-CAPTURE-PROPERTY)Fline-beginning-position
Return the character position of the first character on the current line.
With argument N not nil or 1, move forward N - 1 lines first.
If scan reaches end of buffer, return that position.

The scan does not cross a field boundary unless doing so would move
beyond there to a different line; if N is nil or 1, and scan starts at a
field boundary, the scan stops as soon as it starts.  To ignore field
boundaries bind `inhibit-field-text-motion' to t.

This function does not move point.

(line-beginning-position &optional N)Fline-end-position
Return the character position of the last character on the current line.
With argument N not nil or 1, move forward N - 1 lines first.
If scan reaches end of buffer, return that position.

The scan does not cross a field boundary unless doing so would move
beyond there to a different line; if N is nil or 1, and scan starts at a
field boundary, the scan stops as soon as it starts.  To ignore field
boundaries bind `inhibit-field-text-motion' to t.

This function does not move point.

(line-end-position &optional N)Fsave-excursion
Save point, mark, and current buffer; execute BODY; restore those things.
Executes BODY just like `progn'.
The values of point, mark and the current buffer are restored
even in case of abnormal exit (throw or error).
The state of activation of the mark is also restored.

This construct does not save `deactivate-mark', and therefore
functions that change the buffer will still cause deactivation
of the mark at the end of the command.  To prevent that, bind
`deactivate-mark' with `let'.Fsave-current-buffer
Save the current buffer; execute BODY; restore the current buffer.
Executes BODY just like `progn'.Fbuffer-size
Return the number of characters in the current buffer.
If BUFFER, return the number of characters in that buffer instead.

(buffer-size &optional BUFFER)Fpoint-min
Return the minimum permissible value of point in the current buffer.
This is 1, unless narrowing (a buffer restriction) is in effect.

(point-min)Fpoint-min-marker
Return a marker to the minimum permissible value of point in this buffer.
This is the beginning, unless narrowing (a buffer restriction) is in effect.

(point-min-marker)Fpoint-max
Return the maximum permissible value of point in the current buffer.
This is (1+ (buffer-size)), unless narrowing (a buffer restriction)
is in effect, in which case it is less.

(point-max)Fpoint-max-marker
Return a marker to the maximum permissible value of point in this buffer.
This is (1+ (buffer-size)), unless narrowing (a buffer restriction)
is in effect, in which case it is less.

(point-max-marker)Fgap-position
Return the position of the gap, in the current buffer.
See also `gap-size'.

(gap-position)Fgap-size
Return the size of the current buffer's gap.
See also `gap-position'.

(gap-size)Fposition-bytes
Return the byte position for character position POSITION.
If POSITION is out of range, the value is nil.

(position-bytes POSITION)Fbyte-to-position
Return the character position for byte position BYTEPOS.
If BYTEPOS is out of range, the value is nil.

(byte-to-position BYTEPOS)Ffollowing-char
Return the character following point, as a number.
At the end of the buffer or accessible region, return 0.

(following-char)Fpreceding-char
Return the character preceding point, as a number.
At the beginning of the buffer or accessible region, return 0.

(preceding-char)Fbobp
Return t if point is at the beginning of the buffer.
If the buffer is narrowed, this means the beginning of the narrowed part.

(bobp)Feobp
Return t if point is at the end of the buffer.
If the buffer is narrowed, this means the end of the narrowed part.

(eobp)Fbolp
Return t if point is at the beginning of a line.

(bolp)Feolp
Return t if point is at the end of a line.
`End of a line' includes point being at the end of the buffer.

(eolp)Fchar-after
Return character in current buffer at position POS.
POS is an integer or a marker.
If POS is out of range, the value is nil.

(char-after &optional POS)Fchar-before
Return character in current buffer preceding position POS.
POS is an integer or a marker.
If POS is out of range, the value is nil.

(char-before &optional POS)Fuser-login-name
Return the name under which the user logged in, as a string.
This is based on the effective uid, not the real uid.
Also, if the environment variable LOGNAME or USER is set,
that determines the value of this function.

If optional argument UID is an integer, return the login name of the user
with that uid, or nil if there is no such user.

(user-login-name &optional UID)Fuser-real-login-name
Return the name of the user's real uid, as a string.
This ignores the environment variables LOGNAME and USER, so it differs from
`user-login-name' when running under `su'.

(user-real-login-name)Fuser-uid
Return the effective uid of Emacs, as an integer.

(user-uid)Fuser-real-uid
Return the real uid of Emacs, as an integer.

(user-real-uid)Fuser-full-name
Return the full name of the user logged in, as a string.
If the full name corresponding to Emacs's userid is not known,
return "unknown".

If optional argument UID is an integer, return the full name of the user
with that uid, or nil if there is no such user.
If UID is a string, return the full name of the user with that login
name, or nil if there is no such user.

(user-full-name &optional UID)Fsystem-name
Return the name of the machine you are running on, as a string.

(system-name)Femacs-pid
Return the process ID of Emacs, as an integer.

(emacs-pid)Fcurrent-time
Return the current time, as the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00.
The time is returned as a list of three integers.  The first has the
most significant 16 bits of the seconds, while the second has the
least significant 16 bits.  The third integer gives the microsecond
count.

The microsecond count is zero on systems that do not provide
resolution finer than a second.

(current-time)Ffloat-time
Return the current time, as a float number of seconds since the epoch.
If an argument is given, it specifies a time to convert to float
instead of the current time.  The argument should have the forms:
 (HIGH . LOW) or (HIGH LOW USEC) or (HIGH LOW . USEC).
Thus, you can use times obtained from `current-time'
and from `file-attributes'.

WARNING: Since the result is floating point, it may not be exact.
Do not use this function if precise time stamps are required.

(float-time &optional SPECIFIED-TIME)Fformat-time-string
Use FORMAT-STRING to format the time TIME, or now if omitted.
TIME is specified as (HIGH LOW . IGNORED) or (HIGH . LOW), as returned by
`current-time' or `file-attributes'.
The third, optional, argument UNIVERSAL, if non-nil, means describe TIME
as Universal Time; nil means describe TIME in the local time zone.
The value is a copy of FORMAT-STRING, but with certain constructs replaced
by text that describes the specified date and time in TIME:

%Y is the year, %y within the century, %C the century.
%G is the year corresponding to the ISO week, %g within the century.
%m is the numeric month.
%b and %h are the locale's abbreviated month name, %B the full name.
%d is the day of the month, zero-padded, %e is blank-padded.
%u is the numeric day of week from 1 (Monday) to 7, %w from 0 (Sunday) to 6.
%a is the locale's abbreviated name of the day of week, %A the full name.
%U is the week number starting on Sunday, %W starting on Monday,
 %V according to ISO 8601.
%j is the day of the year.

%H is the hour on a 24-hour clock, %I is on a 12-hour clock, %k is like %H
 only blank-padded, %l is like %I blank-padded.
%p is the locale's equivalent of either AM or PM.
%M is the minute.
%S is the second.
%Z is the time zone name, %z is the numeric form.
%s is the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000.

%c is the locale's date and time format.
%x is the locale's "preferred" date format.
%D is like "%m/%d/%y".

%R is like "%H:%M", %T is like "%H:%M:%S", %r is like "%I:%M:%S %p".
%X is the locale's "preferred" time format.

Finally, %n is a newline, %t is a tab, %% is a literal %.

Certain flags and modifiers are available with some format controls.
The flags are `_', `-', `^' and `#'.  For certain characters X,
%_X is like %X, but padded with blanks; %-X is like %X,
ut without padding.  %^X is like %X but with all textual
characters up-cased; %#X is like %X but with letter-case of
all textual characters reversed.
%NX (where N stands for an integer) is like %X,
but takes up at least N (a number) positions.
The modifiers are `E' and `O'.  For certain characters X,
%EX is a locale's alternative version of %X;
%OX is like %X, but uses the locale's number symbols.

For example, to produce full ISO 8601 format, use "%Y-%m-%dT%T%z".

(format-time-string FORMAT-STRING &optional TIME UNIVERSAL)Fdecode-time
Decode a time value as (SEC MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH YEAR DOW DST ZONE).
The optional SPECIFIED-TIME should be a list of (HIGH LOW . IGNORED)
or (HIGH . LOW), as from `current-time' and `file-attributes', or `nil'
to use the current time.  The list has the following nine members:
SEC is an integer between 0 and 60; SEC is 60 for a leap second, which
only some operating systems support.  MINUTE is an integer between 0 and 59.
HOUR is an integer between 0 and 23.  DAY is an integer between 1 and 31.
MONTH is an integer between 1 and 12.  YEAR is an integer indicating the
four-digit year.  DOW is the day of week, an integer between 0 and 6, where
0 is Sunday.  DST is t if daylight savings time is effect, otherwise nil.
ZONE is an integer indicating the number of seconds east of Greenwich.
(Note that Common Lisp has different meanings for DOW and ZONE.)

(decode-time &optional SPECIFIED-TIME)Fencode-time
Convert SECOND, MINUTE, HOUR, DAY, MONTH, YEAR and ZONE to internal time.
This is the reverse operation of `decode-time', which see.
ZONE defaults to the current time zone rule.  This can
be a string or t (as from `set-time-zone-rule'), or it can be a list
(as from `current-time-zone') or an integer (as from `decode-time')
applied without consideration for daylight savings time.

You can pass more than 7 arguments; then the first six arguments
are used as SECOND through YEAR, and the *last* argument is used as ZONE.
The intervening arguments are ignored.
This feature lets (apply 'encode-time (decode-time ...)) work.

Out-of-range values for SEC, MINUTE, HOUR, DAY, or MONTH are allowed;
for example, a DAY of 0 means the day preceding the given month.
Year numbers less than 100 are treated just like other year numbers.
If you want them to stand for years in this century, you must do that yourself.Fcurrent-time-string
Return the current time, as a human-readable string.
Programs can use this function to decode a time,
since the number of columns in each field is fixed.
The format is `Sun Sep 16 01:03:52 1973'.
However, see also the functions `decode-time' and `format-time-string'
which provide a much more powerful and general facility.

If an argument is given, it specifies a time to format
instead of the current time.  The argument should have the form:
  (HIGH . LOW)
or the form:
  (HIGH LOW . IGNORED).
Thus, you can use times obtained from `current-time'
and from `file-attributes'.

(current-time-string &optional SPECIFIED-TIME)Fcurrent-time-zone
Return the offset and name for the local time zone.
This returns a list of the form (OFFSET NAME).
OFFSET is an integer number of seconds ahead of UTC (east of Greenwich).
    A negative value means west of Greenwich.
NAME is a string giving the name of the time zone.
If an argument is given, it specifies when the time zone offset is determined
instead of using the current time.  The argument should have the form:
  (HIGH . LOW)
or the form:
  (HIGH LOW . IGNORED).
Thus, you can use times obtained from `current-time'
and from `file-attributes'.

Some operating systems cannot provide all this information to Emacs;
in this case, `current-time-zone' returns a list containing nil for
the data it can't find.

(current-time-zone &optional SPECIFIED-TIME)Fset-time-zone-rule
Set the local time zone using TZ, a string specifying a time zone rule.
If TZ is nil, use implementation-defined default time zone information.
If TZ is t, use Universal Time.

(set-time-zone-rule TZ)Finsert
Insert the arguments, either strings or characters, at point.
Point and before-insertion markers move forward to end up
 after the inserted text.
Any other markers at the point of insertion remain before the text.

If the current buffer is multibyte, unibyte strings are converted
to multibyte for insertion (see `unibyte-char-to-multibyte').
If the current buffer is unibyte, multibyte strings are converted
to unibyte for insertion.Finsert-and-inherit
Insert the arguments at point, inheriting properties from adjoining text.
Point and before-insertion markers move forward to end up
 after the inserted text.
Any other markers at the point of insertion remain before the text.

If the current buffer is multibyte, unibyte strings are converted
to multibyte for insertion (see `unibyte-char-to-multibyte').
If the current buffer is unibyte, multibyte strings are converted
to unibyte for insertion.Finsert-before-markers
Insert strings or characters at point, relocating markers after the text.
Point and markers move forward to end up after the inserted text.

If the current buffer is multibyte, unibyte strings are converted
to multibyte for insertion (see `unibyte-char-to-multibyte').
If the current buffer is unibyte, multibyte strings are converted
to unibyte for insertion.Finsert-before-markers-and-inherit
Insert text at point, relocating markers and inheriting properties.
Point and markers move forward to end up after the inserted text.

If the current buffer is multibyte, unibyte strings are converted
to multibyte for insertion (see `unibyte-char-to-multibyte').
If the current buffer is unibyte, multibyte strings are converted
to unibyte for insertion.Finsert-char
Insert COUNT (second arg) copies of CHARACTER (first arg).
Both arguments are required.
Point, and before-insertion markers, are relocated as in the function `insert'.
The optional third arg INHERIT, if non-nil, says to inherit text properties
from adjoining text, if those properties are sticky.

(insert-char CHARACTER COUNT &optional INHERIT)Fbuffer-substring
Return the contents of part of the current buffer as a string.
The two arguments START and END are character positions;
they can be in either order.
The string returned is multibyte if the buffer is multibyte.

This function copies the text properties of that part of the buffer
into the result string; if you don't want the text properties,
use `buffer-substring-no-properties' instead.

(buffer-substring START END)Fbuffer-substring-no-properties
Return the characters of part of the buffer, without the text properties.
The two arguments START and END are character positions;
they can be in either order.

(buffer-substring-no-properties START END)Fbuffer-string
Return the contents of the current buffer as a string.
If narrowing is in effect, this function returns only the visible part
of the buffer.

(buffer-string)Finsert-buffer-substring
Insert before point a substring of the contents of buffer BUFFER.
BUFFER may be a buffer or a buffer name.
Arguments START and END are character numbers specifying the substring.
They default to the beginning and the end of BUFFER.

(insert-buffer-substring BUF &optional START END)Fcompare-buffer-substrings
Compare two substrings of two buffers; return result as number.
the value is -N if first string is less after N-1 chars,
+N if first string is greater after N-1 chars, or 0 if strings match.
Each substring is represented as three arguments: BUFFER, START and END.
That makes six args in all, three for each substring.

The value of `case-fold-search' in the current buffer
determines whether case is significant or ignored.

(compare-buffer-substrings BUFFER1 START1 END1 BUFFER2 START2 END2)Fsubst-char-in-region
From START to END, replace FROMCHAR with TOCHAR each time it occurs.
If optional arg NOUNDO is non-nil, don't record this change for undo
and don't mark the buffer as really changed.
Both characters must have the same length of multi-byte form.

(subst-char-in-region START END FROMCHAR TOCHAR &optional NOUNDO)Ftranslate-region
From START to END, translate characters according to TABLE.
TABLE is a string; the Nth character in it is the mapping
for the character with code N.
This function does not alter multibyte characters.
It returns the number of characters changed.

(translate-region START END TABLE)Fdelete-region
Delete the text between point and mark.
When called from a program, expects two arguments,
positions (integers or markers) specifying the stretch to be deleted.

(delete-region START END)Fdelete-and-extract-region
Delete the text between START and END and return it.

(delete-and-extract-region START END)Fwiden
Remove restrictions (narrowing) from current buffer.
This allows the buffer's full text to be seen and edited.

(widen)Fnarrow-to-region
Restrict editing in this buffer to the current region.
The rest of the text becomes temporarily invisible and untouchable
but is not deleted; if you save the buffer in a file, the invisible
text is included in the file.  \[widen] makes all visible again.
See also `save-restriction'.

When calling from a program, pass two arguments; positions (integers
or markers) bounding the text that should remain visible.

(narrow-to-region START END)Fsave-restriction
Execute BODY, saving and restoring current buffer's restrictions.
The buffer's restrictions make parts of the beginning and end invisible.
(They are set up with `narrow-to-region' and eliminated with `widen'.)
This special form, `save-restriction', saves the current buffer's restrictions
when it is entered, and restores them when it is exited.
So any `narrow-to-region' within BODY lasts only until the end of the form.
The old restrictions settings are restored
even in case of abnormal exit (throw or error).

The value returned is the value of the last form in BODY.

Note: if you are using both `save-excursion' and `save-restriction',
use `save-excursion' outermost:
    (save-excursion (save-restriction ...))Fmessage
Print a one-line message at the bottom of the screen.
The first argument is a format control string, and the rest are data
to be formatted under control of the string.  See `format' for details.

If the first argument is nil, clear any existing message; let the
minibuffer contents show.Fmessage-box
Display a message, in a dialog box if possible.
If a dialog box is not available, use the echo area.
The first argument is a format control string, and the rest are data
to be formatted under control of the string.  See `format' for details.

If the first argument is nil, clear any existing message; let the
minibuffer contents show.Fmessage-or-box
Display a message in a dialog box or in the echo area.
If this command was invoked with the mouse, use a dialog box if
`use-dialog-box' is non-nil.
Otherwise, use the echo area.
The first argument is a format control string, and the rest are data
to be formatted under control of the string.  See `format' for details.

If the first argument is nil, clear any existing message; let the
minibuffer contents show.Fcurrent-message
Return the string currently displayed in the echo area, or nil if none.

(current-message)Fpropertize
Return a copy of STRING with text properties added.
First argument is the string to copy.
Remaining arguments form a sequence of PROPERTY VALUE pairs for text
properties to add to the result Fformat
Format a string out of a control-string and arguments.
The first argument is a control string.
The other arguments are substituted into it to make the result, a string.
It may contain %-sequences meaning to substitute the next argument.
%s means print a string argument.  Actually, prints any object, with `princ'.
%d means print as number in decimal (%o octal, %x hex).
%X is like %x, but uses upper case.
%e means print a number in exponential notation.
%f means print a number in decimal-point notation.
%g means print a number in exponential notation
  or decimal-point notation, whichever uses fewer characters.
%c means print a number as a single character.
%S means print any object as an s-expression (using `prin1').
  The argument used for %d, %o, %x, %e, %f, %g or %c must be a number.
Use %% to put a single % into the output.Fchar-equal
Return t if two characters match, optionally ignoring case.
Both arguments must be characters (i.e. integers).
Case is ignored if `case-fold-search' is non-nil in the current buffer.

(char-equal C1 C2)Ftranspose-regions
Transpose region START1 to END1 with START2 to END2.
The regions may not be overlapping, because the size of the buffer is
never changed in a transposition.

Optional fifth arg LEAVE_MARKERS, if non-nil, means don't update
any markers that happen to be located in the regions.

Transposing beyond buffer boundaries is an error.

(transpose-regions STARTR1 ENDR1 STARTR2 ENDR2 &optional LEAVE-MARKERS)Vinhibit-field-text-motion
Non-nil means text motion commands don't notice fields.Vbuffer-access-fontify-functions
List of functions called by `buffer-substring' to fontify if necessary.
Each function is called with two arguments which specify the range
of the buffer being accessed.Vbuffer-access-fontified-property
Property which (if non-nil) indicates text has been fontified.
`buffer-substring' need not call the `buffer-access-fontify-functions'
functions if all the text being accessed has this property.Vsystem-name
The name of the machine Emacs is running on.Vuser-full-name
The full name of the user logged in.Vuser-login-name
The user's name, taken from environment variables if possible.Vuser-real-login-name
The user's name, based upon the real uid only.Finteractive
Specify a way of parsing arguments for interactive use of a function.
For example, write
  (defun foo (arg) "Doc string" (interactive "p") ...use arg...)
to make ARG be the prefix argument when `foo' is called as a command.
The "call" to `interactive' is actually a declaration rather than a function;
 it tells `call-interactively' how to read arguments
 to pass to the function.
When actually called, `interactive' just returns nil.

The argument of `interactive' is usually a string containing a code letter
 followed by a prompt.  (Some code letters do not use I/O to get
 the argument and do not need prompts.)  To prompt for multiple arguments,
 give a code letter, its prompt, a newline, and another code letter, etc.
 Prompts are passed to format, and may use % escapes to print the
 arguments that have already been read.
If the argument is not a string, it is evaluated to get a list of
 arguments to pass to the function.
Just `(interactive)' means pass no args when calling interactively.

Code letters available are:
a -- Function name: symbol with a function definition.
b -- Name of existing buffer.
B -- Name of buffer, possibly nonexistent.
c -- Character (no input method is used).
C -- Command name: symbol with interactive function definition.
d -- Value of point as number.  Does not do I/O.
D -- Directory name.
e -- Parametrized event (i.e., one that's a list) that invoked this command.
     If used more than once, the Nth `e' returns the Nth parameterized event.
     This skips events that are integers or symbols.
f -- Existing file name.
F -- Possibly nonexistent file name.
i -- Ignored, i.e. always nil.  Does not do I/O.
k -- Key sequence (downcase the last event if needed to get a definition).
K -- Key sequence to be redefined (do not downcase the last event).
m -- Value of mark as number.  Does not do I/O.
M -- Any string.  Inherits the current input method.
n -- Number read using minibuffer.
N -- Raw prefix arg, or if none, do like code `n'.
p -- Prefix arg converted to number.  Does not do I/O.
P -- Prefix arg in raw form.  Does not do I/O.
r -- Region: point and mark as 2 numeric args, smallest first.  Does no I/O.
s -- Any string.  Does not inherit the current input method.
S -- Any symbol.
v -- Variable name: symbol that is user-variable-p.
x -- Lisp expression read but not evaluated.
X -- Lisp expression read and evaluated.
z -- Coding system.
Z -- Coding system, nil if no prefix arg.
In addition, if the string begins with `*'
 then an error is signaled if the buffer is read-only.
 This happens before reading any arguments.
If the string begins with `@', then Emacs searches the key sequence
 which invoked the command for its first mouse click (or any other
 event which specifies a window), and selects that window before
 reading any arguments.  You may use both `@' and `*'; they are
 processed in the order that they appear.

(interactive ARGS)Fcall-interactively
Call FUNCTION, reading args according to its interactive calling specs.
Return the value FUNCTION returns.
The function contains a specification of how to do the argument reading.
In the case of user-defined functions, this is specified by placing a call
to the function `interactive' at the top level of the function body.
See `interactive'.

Optional second arg RECORD-FLAG non-nil
means unconditionally put this command in the command-history.
Otherwise, this is done only if an arg is read using the minibuffer.
Optional third arg KEYS, if given, specifies the sequence of events to
supply if the command inquires which events were used to invoke it.

(call-interactively FUNCTION &optional RECORD-FLAG KEYS)Fprefix-numeric-value
Return numeric meaning of raw prefix argument RAW.
A raw prefix argument is what you get from `(interactive "P")'.
Its numeric meaning is what you would get from `(interactive "p")'.

(prefix-numeric-value RAW)Vprefix-arg
The value of the prefix argument for the next editing command.
It may be a number, or the symbol `-' for just a minus sign as arg,
or a list whose car is a number for just one or more C-U's
or nil if no argument has been specified.

You cannot examine this variable to find the argument for this command
since it has been set to nil by the time you can look.
Instead, you should use the variable `current-prefix-arg', although
normally commands can get this prefix argument with (interactive "P").Vlast-prefix-arg
The value of the prefix argument for the previous editing command.
See `prefix-arg' for the meaning of the value.Vcurrent-prefix-arg
The value of the prefix argument for this editing command.
It may be a number, or the symbol `-' for just a minus sign as arg,
or a list whose car is a number for just one or more C-U's
or nil if no argument has been specified.
This is what `(interactive "P")' returns.Vcommand-history
List of recent commands that read arguments from terminal.
Each command is represented as a form to evaluate.Vcommand-debug-status
Debugging status of current interactive command.
Bound each time `call-interactively' is called;
may be set by the debugger as a reminder for itself.Vmark-even-if-inactive
*Non-nil means you can use the mark even when inactive.
This option makes a difference in Transient Mark mode.
When the option is non-nil, deactivation of the mark
turns off region highlighting, but commands that use the mark
behave as if the mark were still active.Vmouse-leave-buffer-hook
Hook to run when about to switch windows with a mouse command.
Its purpose is to give temporary modes such as Isearch mode
a way to turn themselves off when a mouse command switches windows.For
Eval args until one of them yields non-nil, then return that value.
The remaining args are not evalled at all.
If all args return nil, return nil.Fand
Eval args until one of them yields nil, then return nil.
The remaining args are not evalled at all.
If no arg yields nil, return the last arg's value.Fif
If COND yields non-nil, do THEN, else do ELSE...
Returns the value of THEN or the value of the last of the ELSE's.
THEN must be one expression, but ELSE... can be zero or more expressions.
If COND yields nil, and there are no ELSE's, the value is nil.Fcond
Try each clause until one succeeds.
Each clause looks like (CONDITION BODY...).  CONDITION is evaluated
and, if the value is non-nil, this clause succeeds:
then the expressions in BODY are evaluated and the last one's
value is the value of the cond-form.
If no clause succeeds, cond returns nil.
If a clause has one element, as in (CONDITION),
CONDITION's value if non-nil is returned from the cond-form.Fprogn
Eval BODY forms sequentially and return value of last one.Fprog1
Eval FIRST and BODY sequentially; value from FIRST.
The value of FIRST is saved during the evaluation of the remaining args,
whose values are discarded.Fprog2
Eval X, Y and BODY sequentially; value from Y.
The value of Y is saved during the evaluation of the remaining args,
whose values are discarded.Fsetq
Set each SYM to the value of its VAL.
The symbols SYM are variables; they are literal (not evaluated).
The values VAL are expressions; they are evaluated.
Thus, (setq x (1+ y)) sets `x' to the value of `(1+ y)'.
The second VAL is not computed until after the first SYM is set, and so on;
each VAL can use the new value of variables set earlier in the `setq'.
The return value of the `setq' form is the value of the last VAL.Fquote
Return the argument, without evaluating it.  `(quote x)' yields `x'.Ffunction
Like `quote', but preferred for objects which are functions.
In byte compilation, `function' causes its argument to be compiled.
`quote' cannot do that.Finteractive-p
Return t if function in which this appears was called interactively.
This means that the function was called with call-interactively (which
includes being called as the binding of a key)
and input is currently coming from the keyboard (not in keyboard macro).

(interactive-p)Fdefun
Define NAME as a function.
The definition is (lambda ARGLIST [DOCSTRING] BODY...).
See also the function `interactive'.Fdefmacro
Define NAME as a macro.
The definition is (macro lambda ARGLIST [DOCSTRING] BODY...).
When the macro is called, as in (NAME ARGS...),
the function (lambda ARGLIST BODY...) is applied to
the list ARGS... as it appears in the expression,
and the result should be a form to be evaluated instead of the original.Fdefvar
Define SYMBOL as a variable.
You are not required to define a variable in order to use it,
but the definition can supply documentation and an initial value
in a way that tags can recognize.

INITVALUE is evaluated, and used to set SYMBOL, only if SYMBOL's value is void.
If SYMBOL is buffer-local, its default value is what is set;
 buffer-local values are not affected.
INITVALUE and DOCSTRING are optional.
If DOCSTRING starts with *, this variable is identified as a user option.
 This means that M-x set-variable recognizes it.
 See also `user-variable-p'.
If INITVALUE is missing, SYMBOL's value is not set.Fdefconst
Define SYMBOL as a constant variable.
The intent is that neither programs nor users should ever change this value.
Always sets the value of SYMBOL to the result of evalling INITVALUE.
If SYMBOL is buffer-local, its default value is what is set;
 buffer-local values are not affected.
DOCSTRING is optional.Fuser-variable-p
Returns t if VARIABLE is intended to be set and modified by users.
(The alternative is a variable used internally in a Lisp program.)
Determined by whether the first character of the documentation
for the variable is `*' or if the variable is customizable (has a non-nil
value of any of `custom-type', `custom-loads' or `standard-value'
on its property list).

(user-variable-p VARIABLE)Flet*
Bind variables according to VARLIST then eval BODY.
The value of the last form in BODY is returned.
Each element of VARLIST is a symbol (which is bound to nil)
or a list (SYMBOL VALUEFORM) (which binds SYMBOL to the value of VALUEFORM).
Each VALUEFORM can refer to the symbols already bound by this VARLIST.Flet
Bind variables according to VARLIST then eval BODY.
The value of the last form in BODY is returned.
Each element of VARLIST is a symbol (which is bound to nil)
or a list (SYMBOL VALUEFORM) (which binds SYMBOL to the value of VALUEFORM).
All the VALUEFORMs are evalled before any symbols are bound.Fwhile
If TEST yields non-nil, eval BODY... and repeat.
The order of execution is thus TEST, BODY, TEST, BODY and so on
until TEST returns nil.Fmacroexpand
Return result of expanding macros at top level of FORM.
If FORM is not a macro call, it is returned unchanged.
Otherwise, the macro is expanded and the expansion is considered
in place of FORM.  When a non-macro-call results, it is returned.

The second optional arg ENVIRONMENT specifies an environment of macro
definitions to shadow the loaded ones for use in file byte-compilation.

(macroexpand FORM &optional ENVIRONMENT)Fcatch
Eval BODY allowing nonlocal exits using `throw'.
TAG is evalled to get the tag to use; it must not be nil.

Then the BODY is executed.
Within BODY, (throw TAG) with same tag exits BODY and exits this `catch'.
If no throw happens, `catch' returns the value of the last BODY form.
If a throw happens, it specifies the value to return from `catch'.Fthrow
Throw to the catch for TAG and return VALUE from it.
Both TAG and VALUE are evalled.

(throw TAG VALUE)Funwind-protect
Do BODYFORM, protecting with UNWINDFORMS.
If BODYFORM completes normally, its value is returned
after executing the UNWINDFORMS.
If BODYFORM exits nonlocally, the UNWINDFORMS are executed anyway.Fcondition-case
Regain control when an error is signaled.
executes BODYFORM and returns its value if no error happens.
Each element of HANDLERS looks like (CONDITION-NAME BODY...)
where the BODY is made of Lisp expressions.

A handler is applicable to an error
if CONDITION-NAME is one of the error's condition names.
If an error happens, the first applicable handler is run.

The car of a handler may be a list of condition names
instead of a single condition name.

When a handler handles an error,
control returns to the condition-case and the handler BODY... is executed
with VAR bound to (SIGNALED-CONDITIONS . SIGNAL-DATA).
VAR may be nil; then you do not get access to the signal information.

The value of the last BODY form is returned from the condition-case.
See also the function `signal' for more info.Fsignal
Signal an error.  Args are ERROR-SYMBOL and associated DATA.
This function does not return.

An error symbol is a symbol with an `error-conditions' property
that is a list of condition names.
A handler for any of those names will get to handle this signal.
The symbol `error' should normally be one of them.

DATA should be a list.  Its elements are printed as part of the error message.
If the signal is handled, DATA is made available to the handler.
See also the function `condition-case'.

(signal ERROR-SYMBOL DATA)Fcommandp
T if FUNCTION makes provisions for interactive calling.
This means it contains a description for how to read arguments to give it.
The value is nil for an invalid function or a symbol with no function
definition.

Interactively callable functions include strings and vectors (treated
as keyboard macros), lambda-expressions that contain a top-level call
to `interactive', autoload definitions made by `autoload' with non-nil
fourth argument, and some of the built-in functions of Lisp.

Also, a symbol satisfies `commandp' if its function definition does so.

(commandp FUNCTION)Fautoload
Define FUNCTION to autoload from FILE.
FUNCTION is a symbol; FILE is a file name string to pass to `load'.
Third arg DOCSTRING is documentation for the function.
Fourth arg INTERACTIVE if non-nil says function can be called interactively.
Fifth arg TYPE indicates the type of the object:
   nil or omitted says FUNCTION is a function,
   `keymap' says FUNCTION is really a keymap, and
   `macro' or t says FUNCTION is really a macro.
Third through fifth args give info about the real definition.
They default to nil.
If FUNCTION is already defined other than as an autoload,
this does nothing and returns nil.

(autoload FUNCTION FILE &optional DOCSTRING INTERACTIVE TYPE)Feval
Evaluate FORM and return its value.

(eval FORM)Fapply
Call FUNCTION with our remaining args, using our last arg as list of args.
Then return the value FUNCTION returns.
Thus, (apply '+ 1 2 '(3 4)) returns 10.Frun-hooks
Run each hook in HOOKS.  Major mode functions use this.
Each argument should be a symbol, a hook variable.
These symbols are processed in the order specified.
If a hook symbol has a non-nil value, that value may be a function
or a list of functions to be called to run the hook.
If the value is a function, it is called with no arguments.
If it is a list, the elements are called, in order, with no arguments.

Do not use `make-local-variable' to make a hook variable buffer-local.
Instead, use `add-hook' and specify t for the LOCAL argument.
not `make-local-variable'.Frun-hook-with-args
Run HOOK with the specified arguments ARGS.
HOOK should be a symbol, a hook variable.  If HOOK has a non-nil
value, that value may be a function or a list of functions to be
called to run the hook.  If the value is a function, it is called with
the given arguments and its return value is returned.  If it is a list
of functions, those functions are called, in order,
with the given arguments ARGS.
It is best not to depend on the value return by `run-hook-with-args',
as that may change.

Do not use `make-local-variable' to make a hook variable buffer-local.
Instead, use `add-hook' and specify t for the LOCAL argument.
not `make-local-variable'.Frun-hook-with-args-until-success
Run HOOK with the specified arguments ARGS.
HOOK should be a symbol, a hook variable.  Its value should
be a list of functions.  We call those functions, one by one,
passing arguments ARGS to each of them, until one of them
returns a non-nil value.  Then we return that value.
If all the functions return nil, we return nil.

Do not use `make-local-variable' to make a hook variable buffer-local.
Instead, use `add-hook' and specify t for the LOCAL argument.
not `make-local-variable'.Frun-hook-with-args-until-failure
Run HOOK with the specified arguments ARGS.
HOOK should be a symbol, a hook variable.  Its value should
be a list of functions.  We call those functions, one by one,
passing arguments ARGS to each of them, until one of them
returns nil.  Then we return nil.
If all the functions return non-nil, we return non-nil.

Do not use `make-local-variable' to make a hook variable buffer-local.
Instead, use `add-hook' and specify t for the LOCAL argument.
not `make-local-variable'.Ffuncall
Call first argument as a function, passing remaining arguments to it.
Return the value that function returns.
Thus, (funcall 'cons 'x 'y) returns (x . y).Ffetch-bytecode
If byte-compiled OBJECT is lazy-loaded, fetch it now.

(fetch-bytecode OBJECT)Fbacktrace-debug
Set the debug-on-exit flag of eval frame LEVEL levels down to FLAG.
The debugger is entered when that frame exits, if the flag is non-nil.

(backtrace-debug LEVEL FLAG)Fbacktrace
Print a trace of Lisp function calls currently active.
Output stream used is value of `standard-output'.

(backtrace)Fbacktrace-frame
Return the function and arguments NFRAMES up from current execution point.
If that frame has not evaluated the arguments yet (or is a special form),
the value is (nil FUNCTION ARG-FORMS...).
If that frame has evaluated its arguments and called its function already,
the value is (t FUNCTION ARG-VALUES...).
A &rest arg is represented as the tail of the list ARG-VALUES.
FUNCTION is whatever was supplied as car of evaluated list,
or a lambda expression for macro calls.
If NFRAMES is more than the number of frames, the value is nil.

(backtrace-frame NFRAMES)Vmax-specpdl-size
*Limit on number of Lisp variable bindings & unwind-protects.
If Lisp code tries to make more than this many at once,
an error is signaled.Vmax-lisp-eval-depth
*Limit on depth in `eval', `apply' and `funcall' before error.
This limit is to catch infinite recursions for you before they cause
actual stack overflow in C, which would be fatal for Emacs.
You can safely make it considerably larger than its default value,
if that proves inconveniently small.Vquit-flag
Non-nil causes `eval' to abort, unless `inhibit-quit' is non-nil.
Typing C-g sets `quit-flag' non-nil, regardless of `inhibit-quit'.Vinhibit-quit
Non-nil inhibits C-g quitting from happening immediately.
Note that `quit-flag' will still be set by typing C-g,
so a quit will be signaled as soon as `inhibit-quit' is nil.
To prevent this happening, set `quit-flag' to nil
before making `inhibit-quit' nil.Vstack-trace-on-error
*Non-nil means automatically display a backtrace buffer
after any error that is handled by the editor command loop.
If the value is a list, an error only means to display a backtrace
if one of its condition symbols appears in the list.Vdebug-on-error
*Non-nil means enter debugger if an error is signaled.
Does not apply to errors handled by `condition-case' or those
matched by `debug-ignored-errors'.
If the value is a list, an error only means to enter the debugger
if one of its condition symbols appears in the list.
When you evaluate an expression interactively, this variable
is temporarily non-nil if `eval-expression-debug-on-error' is non-nil.
See also variable `debug-on-quit'.Vdebug-ignored-errors
*List of errors for which the debugger should not be called.
Each element may be a condition-name or a regexp that matches error messages.
If any element applies to a given error, that error skips the debugger
and just returns to top level.
This overrides the variable `debug-on-error'.
It does not apply to errors handled by `condition-case'.Vdebug-on-quit
*Non-nil means enter debugger if quit is signaled (C-g, for example).
Does not apply if quit is handled by a `condition-case'.
When you evaluate an expression interactively, this variable
is temporarily non-nil if `eval-expression-debug-on-quit' is non-nil.Vdebug-on-next-call
Non-nil means enter debugger before next `eval', `apply' or `funcall'.Vdebugger-may-continue
Non-nil means debugger may continue execution.
This is nil when the debugger is called under circumstances where it
might not be safe to continue.Vdebugger
Function to call to invoke debugger.
If due to frame exit, args are `exit' and the value being returned;
 this function's value will be returned instead of that.
If due to error, args are `error' and a list of the args to `signal'.
If due to `apply' or `funcall' entry, one arg, `lambda'.
If due to `eval' entry, one arg, t.Vsignal-hook-function
If non-nil, this is a function for `signal' to call.
It receives the same arguments that `signal' was given.
The Edebug package uses this to regain control.Vmocklisp-arguments
While in a mocklisp function, the list of its unevaluated args.Vdebug-on-signal
*Non-nil means call the debugger regardless of condition handlers.
Note that `debug-on-error', `debug-on-quit' and friends
still determine whether to handle the particular condition.Facos

With optional DIVISOR, return the largest integer no greater than ARG/DIVISOR.

(floor ARG &optional DIVISOR)Fround
Return the nearest integer to ARG.
With optional DIVISOR, return the nearest integer to ARG/DIVISOR.

Rounding a value equidistant between two integers may choose the
integer closer to zero, or it may prefer an even integer, depending on
your machine.  For example, (round 2.5) can return 3 on some
systems, but 2 on others.

(round ARG &optional DIVISOR)Ftruncate

All integers representable in Lisp are equally likely.
  On most systems, this is 28 bits' worth.
With positive integer argument N, return random number in interval [0,N).
With argument t, set the random number seed from the current time and pid.

(random &optional N)Flength
Return the length of vector, list or string SEQUENCE.
A byte-code function object is also allowed.
If the string contains multibyte characters, this is not the necessarily
the number of bytes in the string; it is the number of characters.
To get the number of bytes, use `string-bytes'

(length SEQUENCE)Fsafe-length
Return the length of a list, but avoid error or infinite loop.
This function never gets an error.  If LIST is not really a list,
it returns 0.  If LIST is circular, it returns a finite value
which is at least the number of distinct elements.

(safe-length LIST)Fstring-bytes
Return the number of bytes in STRING.
If STRING is a multibyte string, this is greater than the length of STRING.

(string-bytes STRING)Fstring-equal
Return t if two strings have identical contents.
Case is significant, but text properties are ignored.
Symbols are also allowed; their print names are used instead.

(string-equal S1 S2)Fcompare-strings
Compare the contents of two strings, converting to multibyte if needed.
In string STR1, skip the first START1 characters and stop at END1.
In string STR2, skip the first START2 characters and stop at END2.
END1 and END2 default to the full lengths of the respective strings.

Case is significant in this comparison if IGNORE-CASE is nil.
Unibyte strings are converted to multibyte for comparison.

The value is t if the strings (or specified portions) match.
If string STR1 is less, the value is a negative number N;
  - 1 - N is the number of characters that match at the beginning.
If string STR1 is greater, the value is a positive number N;
  N - 1 is the number of characters that match at the beginning.

(compare-strings STR1 START1 END1 STR2 START2 END2 &optional IGNORE-CASE)Fstring-lessp
Return t if first arg string is less than second in lexicographic order.
Case is significant.
Symbols are also allowed; their print names are used instead.

The elements of a list or vector are not copied; they are shared
with the original.

(copy-sequence ARG)Fstring-make-multibyte
Return the multibyte equivalent of STRING.
The function `unibyte-char-to-multibyte' is used to convert
each unibyte character to a multibyte character.

(string-make-multibyte STRING)Fstring-make-unibyte
Return the unibyte equivalent of STRING.
Multibyte character codes are converted to unibyte
by using just the low 8 bits.

(string-make-unibyte STRING)Fstring-as-unibyte
Return a unibyte string with the same individual bytes as STRING.
If STRING is unibyte, the result is STRING itself.
Otherwise it is a newly created string, with no text properties.
If STRING is multibyte and contains a character of charset
`eight-bit-control' or `eight-bit-graphic', it is converted to the
corresponding single byte.

(string-as-unibyte STRING)Fstring-as-multibyte
Return a multibyte string with the same individual bytes as STRING.
If STRING is multibyte, the result is STRING itself.
Otherwise it is a newly created string, with no text properties.
If STRING is unibyte and contains an individual 8-bit byte (i.e. not
part of a multibyte form), it is converted to the corresponding
multibyte character of charset `eight-bit-control' or `eight-bit-graphic'.

(string-as-multibyte STRING)Fcopy-alist
Return a copy of ALIST.
This is an alist which represents the same mapping from objects to objects,
but does not share the alist structure with ALIST.
The objects mapped (cars and cdrs of elements of the alist)
are shared, however.
Elements of ALIST that are not conses are also shared.

(copy-alist ALIST)Fsubstring
Return a substring of STRING, starting at index FROM and ending before TO.
TO may be nil or omitted; then the substring runs to the end of STRING.
If FROM or TO is negative, it counts from the end.

This function allows vectors as well as strings.

(substring STRING FROM &optional TO)Fnthcdr
Take cdr N times on LIST, returns the result.

(nthcdr N LIST)Fnth
Return the Nth element of LIST.
N counts from zero.  If LIST is not that long, nil is returned.

(rassoc KEY LIST)Fdelq
Delete by side effect any occurrences of ELT as a member of LIST.
The modified LIST is returned.  Comparison is done with `eq'.
If the first member of LIST is ELT, there is no way to remove it by side effect;
therefore, write `(setq foo (delq element foo))'
to be sure of changing the value of `foo'.

(delq ELT LIST)Fdelete
Delete by side effect any occurrences of ELT as a member of SEQ.
SEQ must be a list, a vector, or a string.
The modified SEQ is returned.  Comparison is done with `equal'.
If SEQ is not a list, or the first member of SEQ is ELT, deleting it
is not a side effect; it is simply using a different sequence.
Therefore, write `(setq foo (delete element foo))'
to be sure of changing the value of `foo'.

(delete ELT SEQ)Fnreverse
Reverse LIST by modifying cdr pointers.
Returns the beginning of the reversed list.

(nreverse LIST)Freverse

PREDICATE is called with two elements of LIST, and should return T
if the first element is "less" than the second.

(sort LIST PREDICATE)Fplist-get
Extract a value from a property list.
PLIST is a property list, which is a list of the form
(PROP1 VALUE1 PROP2 VALUE2...).  This function returns the value
corresponding to the given PROP, or nil if PROP is not
one of the properties on the list.

(plist-get PLIST PROP)Fget
Return the value of SYMBOL's PROPNAME property.
This is the last value stored with `(put SYMBOL PROPNAME VALUE)'.

Change value in PLIST of PROP to VAL.
PLIST is a property list, which is a list of the form
(PROP1 VALUE1 PROP2 VALUE2 ...).  PROP is a symbol and VAL is any object.
If PROP is already a property on the list, its value is set to VAL,
otherwise the new PROP VAL pair is added.  The new plist is returned;
use `(setq x (plist-put x prop val))' to be sure to use the new value.
The PLIST is modified by side effects.

(plist-put PLIST PROP VAL)Fput
Store SYMBOL's PROPNAME property with value VALUE.
It can be retrieved with `(get SYMBOL PROPNAME)'.

(put SYMBOL PROPNAME VALUE)Fequal
Return t if two Lisp objects have similar structure and contents.
They must have the same data type.
Conses are compared by comparing the cars and the cdrs.
Vectors and strings are compared element by element.

If CHAR-TABLE holds nil for a given character,
then the actual applicable value is inherited from the parent char-table
(or from its parents, if necessary).

(char-table-parent CHAR-TABLE)Fset-char-table-parent
Set the parent char-table of CHAR-TABLE to PARENT.
PARENT must be either nil or another char-table.

a vector which identifies a character set or a row of a character set,
a character set name, or a character code.

(char-table-range CHAR-TABLE RANGE)Fset-char-table-range
Set the value in CHAR-TABLE for a range of characters RANGE to VALUE.
RANGE should be t (for all characters), nil (for the default value)
a vector which identifies a character set or a row of a character set,
a coding system, or a character code.

(set-char-table-range CHAR-TABLE RANGE VALUE)Fset-char-table-default
Set the default value in CHAR-TABLE for a generic character CHAR to VALUE.

The key is always a possible IDX argument to `aref'.

(map-char-table FUNCTION CHAR-TABLE)Fnconc
Concatenate any number of lists by altering them.
Only the last argument is not altered, and need not be a list.Fmapconcat
Apply FUNCTION to each element of SEQUENCE, and concat the results as strings.
In between each pair of results, stick in SEPARATOR.  Thus, " " as
SEPARATOR results in spaces between the values returned by FUNCTION.
SEQUENCE may be a list, a vector, a bool-vector, or a string.

(mapconcat FUNCTION SEQUENCE SEPARATOR)Fmapcar
Apply FUNCTION to each element of SEQUENCE, and make a list of the results.
The result is a list just as long as SEQUENCE.
SEQUENCE may be a list, a vector, a bool-vector, or a string.

(mapcar FUNCTION SEQUENCE)Fmapc
Apply FUNCTION to each element of SEQUENCE for side effects only.
Unlike `mapcar', don't accumulate the results.  Return SEQUENCE.
SEQUENCE may be a list, a vector, a bool-vector, or a string.

(mapc FUNCTION SEQUENCE)Fy-or-n-p
Ask user a "y or n" question.  Return t if answer is "y".
Takes one argument, which is the string to display to ask the question.
It should end in a space; `y-or-n-p' adds `(y or n) ' to it.
No confirmation of the answer is requested; a single character is enough.
Also accepts Space to mean yes, or Delete to mean no.  (Actually, it uses
the bindings in `query-replace-map'; see the documentation of that variable
for more information.  In this case, the useful bindings are `act', `skip',
`recenter', and `quit'.)

Under a windowing system a dialog box will be used if `last-nonmenu-event'
is nil and `use-dialog-box' is non-nil.

(y-or-n-p PROMPT)Fyes-or-no-p
Ask user a yes-or-no question.  Return t if answer is yes.
Takes one argument, which is the string to display to ask the question.
It should end in a space; `yes-or-no-p' adds `(yes or no) ' to it.
The user must confirm the answer with RET,
and can edit it until it has been confirmed.

Under a windowing system a dialog box will be used if `last-nonmenu-event'
is nil, and `use-dialog-box' is non-nil.

(yes-or-no-p PROMPT)Fload-average
Return list of 1 minute, 5 minute and 15 minute load averages.
Each of the three load averages is multiplied by 100,
then converted to integer.
When USE-FLOATS is non-nil, floats will be used instead of integers.
These floats are not multiplied by 100.

If the 5-minute or 15-minute load averages are not available, return a
shortened list, containing only those averages which are available.

(load-average &optional USE-FLOATS)Ffeaturep
Returns t if FEATURE is present in this Emacs.
Use this to conditionalize execution of lisp code based on the presence or
absence of emacs or environment extensions.
Use `provide' to declare that a feature is available.
This function looks at the value of the variable `features'.

(featurep FEATURE)Fprovide
Announce that FEATURE is a feature of the current Emacs.

(provide FEATURE)Frequire
If feature FEATURE is not loaded, load it from FILENAME.
If FEATURE is not a member of the list `features', then the feature
is not loaded; so load the file FILENAME.
If FILENAME is omitted, the printname of FEATURE is used as the file name,
and `load' will try to load this name appended with the suffix `.elc',
`.el' or the unmodified name, in that order.
If the optional third argument NOERROR is non-nil,
then return nil if the file is not found instead of signaling an error.
Normally the return value is FEATURE.
The normal messages at start and end of loading FILENAME are suppressed.

(require FEATURE &optional FILENAME NOERROR)Fplist-member
Return non-nil if PLIST has the property PROP.
PLIST is a property list, which is a list of the form
(PROP1 VALUE1 PROP2 VALUE2 ...).  PROP is a symbol.
Unlike `plist-get', this allows you to distinguish between a missing
property and a property with the value nil.
The value is actually the tail of PLIST whose car is PROP.

(plist-member PLIST PROP)Fwidget-put
In WIDGET, set PROPERTY to VALUE.
The value can later be retrieved with `widget-get'.

(widget-put WIDGET PROPERTY VALUE)Fwidget-get

Optional second argument NO-LINE-BREAK means do not break long lines
into shorter lines.

(base64-encode-string STRING &optional NO-LINE-BREAK)Fbase64-decode-region
Base64-decode the region between BEG and END.
Return the length of the decoded text.

(sxhash OBJ)Fmake-hash-table
Create and return a new hash table.
Arguments are specified as keyword/argument pairs.  The following
arguments are defined:

:test TEST -- TEST must be a symbol that specifies how to compare keys.
Default is `eql'.  Predefined are the tests `eq', `eql', and `equal'.
User-supplied test and hash functions can be specified via
`define-hash-table-test'.

:size SIZE -- A hint as to how many elements will be put in the table.
Default is 65.

:rehash-size REHASH-SIZE - Indicates how to expand the table when
it fills up.  If REHASH-SIZE is an integer, add that many space.
If it is a float, it must be > 1.0, and the new size is computed by
multiplying the old size with that factor.  Default is 1.5.

:rehash-threshold THRESHOLD -- THRESHOLD must a float > 0, and <= 1.0.
Resize the hash table when ratio of the number of entries in the table.
Default is 0.8.

:weakness WEAK -- WEAK must be one of nil, t, `key', `value',
`key-or-value', or `key-and-value'.  If WEAK is not nil, the table returned
is a weak table.  Key/value pairs are removed from a weak hash table when
there are no non-weak references pointing to their key, value, one of key
or value, or both key and value, depending on WEAK.  WEAK t is equivalent
to `key-and-value'.  Default value of WEAK is nil.Fcopy-hash-table
Return a copy of hash table TABLE.

(copy-hash-table TABLE)Fmakehash
Create a new hash table.
Optional first argument TEST specifies how to compare keys in
the table.  Predefined tests are `eq', `eql', and `equal'.  Default
is `eql'.  New tests can be defined with `define-hash-table-test'.

(makehash &optional TEST)Fhash-table-count

(remhash KEY TABLE)Fmaphash
Call FUNCTION for all entries in hash table TABLE.
FUNCTION is called with 2 arguments KEY and VALUE.

(maphash FUNCTION TABLE)Fdefine-hash-table-test
Define a new hash table test with name NAME, a symbol.
In hash tables create with NAME specified as test, use TEST to compare
keys, and HASH for computing hash codes of keys.

TEST must be a function taking two arguments and returning non-nil
if both arguments are the same.   HASH must be a function taking
one argument and return an integer that is the hash code of the
argument.  Hash code computation should use the whole value range of
integers, including negative integers.

(define-hash-table-test NAME TEST HASH)Fmd5
Return MD5 message digest of OBJECT, a buffer or string.
A message digest is a cryptographic checksum of a document,
and the algorithm to calculate it is defined in RFC 1321.

The two optional arguments START and END are character positions
specifying for which part of OBJECT the message digest should be computed.
If nil or omitted, the digest is computed for the whole OBJECT.

The MD5 message digest is computed from the result of encoding the
text in a coding system, not directly from the internal Emacs form
of the text.  The optional fourth argument CODING-SYSTEM specifies
which coding system to encode the text with.  It should be the same
coding system that you used or will use when actually writing the text
into a file.

If CODING-SYSTEM is nil or omitted, the default depends on OBJECT.
If OBJECT is a buffer, the default for CODING-SYSTEM is whatever
coding system would be chosen by default for writing this text
into a file.

If OBJECT is a string, the most preferred coding system (see the
command `prefer-coding-system') is used.

If NOERROR is non-nil, silently assume the `raw-text' coding if the
guesswork fails.  Normally, an error is signaled in such case.

(md5 OBJECT &optional START END CODING-SYSTEM NOERROR)Vfeatures
A list of symbols which are the features of the executing emacs.
Used by `featurep' and `require', and altered by `provide'.Vuse-dialog-box
*Non-nil means mouse commands use dialog boxes to ask questions.
This applies to y-or-n and yes-or-no questions asked by commands
invoked by mouse clicks and mouse menu items.Fwrite-char
Output character CHARACTER to stream PRINTCHARFUN.
PRINTCHARFUN defaults to the value of `standard-output' (which see).

(write-char CHARACTER &optional PRINTCHARFUN)Fwith-output-to-temp-buffer
Bind `standard-output' to buffer BUFNAME, eval BODY, then show that buffer.
The buffer is cleared out initially, and marked as unmodified when done.
All output done by BODY is inserted in that buffer by default.
The buffer is displayed in another window, but not selected.
The value of the last form in BODY is returned.
If BODY does not finish normally, the buffer BUFNAME is not displayed.

The hook `temp-buffer-setup-hook' is run before BODY,
with the buffer BUFNAME temporarily current.
The hook `temp-buffer-show-hook' is run after the buffer is displayed,
with the buffer temporarily current, and the window that was used
to display it temporarily selected.

If variable `temp-buffer-show-function' is non-nil, call it at the end
to get the buffer displayed instead of just displaying the non-selected
buffer and calling the hook.  It gets one argument, the buffer to display.Fterpri
Output a newline to stream PRINTCHARFUN.
If PRINTCHARFUN is omitted or nil, the value of `standard-output' is used.

(terpri &optional PRINTCHARFUN)Fprin1
Output the printed representation of OBJECT, any Lisp object.
Quoting characters are printed when needed to make output that `read'
can handle, whenever this is possible.

OBJECT is any of the Lisp data types: a number, a string, a symbol,
a list, a buffer, a window, a frame, etc.

A printed representation of an object is text which describes that object.

Optional argument PRINTCHARFUN is the output stream, which can be one
of these:

   - a buffer, in which case output is inserted into that buffer at point;
   - a marker, in which case output is inserted at marker's position;
   - a function, in which case that function is called once for each
     character of OBJECT's printed representation;
   - a symbol, in which case that symbol's function definition is called; or
   - t, in which case the output is displayed in the echo area.

If PRINTCHARFUN is omitted, the value of `standard-output' (which see)
is used instead.

(prin1 OBJECT &optional PRINTCHARFUN)Fprin1-to-string
Return a string containing the printed representation of OBJECT,
any Lisp object.  Quoting characters are used when needed to make output
that `read' can handle, whenever this is possible, unless the optional

If PRINTCHARFUN is omitted, the value of `standard-output' (which see)
is used instead.

(princ OBJECT &optional PRINTCHARFUN)Fprint
Output the printed representation of OBJECT, with newlines around it.
Quoting characters are printed when needed to make output that `read'
can handle, whenever this is possible.

OBJECT is any of the Lisp data types: a number, a string, a symbol,
a list, a buffer, a window, a frame, etc.

A printed representation of an object is text which describes that object.

Optional argument PRINTCHARFUN is the output stream, which can be one
of these:

   - a buffer, in which case output is inserted into that buffer at point;
   - a marker, in which case output is inserted at marker's position;
   - a function, in which case that function is called once for each
     character of OBJECT's printed representation;
   - a symbol, in which case that symbol's function definition is called; or

If PRINTCHARFUN is omitted, the value of `standard-output' (which see)
is used instead.

(print OBJECT &optional PRINTCHARFUN)Fexternal-debugging-output
Write CHARACTER to stderr.
You can call print while debugging emacs, and pass it this function
to make it write to the debugging output.


(external-debugging-output CHARACTER)Ferror-message-string
Convert an error value (ERROR-SYMBOL . DATA) to an error message.

(error-message-string OBJ)Vstandard-output
Output stream `print' uses by default for outputting a character.
This may be any function of one argument.
It may also be a buffer (output is inserted before point)
or a marker (output is inserted and the marker is advanced)
or the symbol t (output appears in the echo area).Vfloat-output-format
The format descriptor string used to print floats.
This is a %-spec like those accepted by `printf' in C,
but with some restrictions.  It must start with the two characters `%.'.
After that comes an integer precision specification,
and then a letter which controls the format.
The letters allowed are `e', `f' and `g'.
Use `e' for exponential notation "DIG.DIGITSeEXPT"
Use `f' for decimal point notation "DIGITS.DIGITS".
Use `g' to choose the shorter of those two formats for the number at hand.
The precision in any of these cases is the number of digits following
the decimal point.  With `f', a precision of 0 means to omit the
decimal point.  0 is not allowed with `e' or `g'.

A value of nil means to use the shortest notation
that represents the number without losing information.Vprint-length
Maximum length of list to print before abbreviating.
A value of nil means no limit.  See also `eval-expression-print-length'.Vprint-level
Maximum depth of list nesting to print before abbreviating.
A value of nil means no limit.  See also `eval-expression-print-level'.Vprint-escape-newlines
Non-nil means print newlines in strings as `\n'.
Also print formfeeds as `\f'.Vprint-escape-nonascii
Non-nil means print unibyte non-ASCII chars in strings as \OOO.
(OOO is the octal representation of the character code.)
Only single-byte characters are affected, and only in `prin1'.Vprint-escape-multibyte
Non-nil means print multibyte characters in strings as \xXXXX.
(XXXX is the hex representation of the character code.)
This affects only `prin1'.Vprint-quoted
Non-nil means print quoted forms with reader syntax.
I.e., (quote foo) prints as 'foo, (function foo) as #'foo, and backquoted
forms print as in the new syntax.Vprint-gensym
Non-nil means print uninterned symbols so they will read as uninterned.
I.e., the value of (make-symbol "foobar") prints as #:foobar.
When the uninterned symbol appears within a recursive data structure,
and the symbol appears more than once, in addition use the #N# and #N=
constructs as needed, so that multiple references to the same symbol are
shared once again when the text is read back.Vprint-circle
*Non-nil means print recursive structures using #N= and #N# syntax.
If nil, printing proceeds recursively and may lead to
`max-lisp-eval-depth' being exceeded or an error may occur:
"Apparently circular structure being printed."  Also see
`print-length' and `print-level'.
If non-nil, shared substructures anywhere in the structure are printed
with `#N=' before the first occurrence (in the order of the print
representation) and `#N#' in place of each subsequent occurrence,
where N is a positive decimal integer.Vprint-continuous-numbering
*Non-nil means number continuously across print calls.
This affects the numbers printed for #N= labels and #M# references.
See also `print-circle', `print-gensym', and `print-number-table'.
This variable should not be set with `setq'; bind it with a `let' instead.Vprint-number-table
A vector used internally to produce `#N=' labels and `#N#' references.
The Lisp printer uses this vector to detect Lisp objects referenced more
than once.  When `print-continuous-numbering' is bound to t, you should
probably also bind `print-number-table' to nil.  This ensures that the
value of `print-number-table' can be garbage-collected once the printing
is done.Fread-char
Read a character from the command input (keyboard or macro).
It is returned as a number.
If the user generates an event which is not a character (i.e. a mouse
click or function key event), `read-char' signals an error.  As an
exception, switch-frame events are put off until non-ASCII events can
be read.
If you want to read non-character events, or ignore them, call
`read-event' or `read-char-exclusive' instead.

If the optional argument PROMPT is non-nil, display that as a prompt.
If the optional argument INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD is non-nil and some
input method is turned on in the current buffer, that input method
is used for reading a character.

(read-char &optional PROMPT INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD)Fread-event
Read an event object from the input stream.
If the optional argument PROMPT is non-nil, display that as a prompt.
If the optional argument INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD is non-nil and some
input method is turned on in the current buffer, that input method
is used for reading a character.

(read-event &optional PROMPT INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD)Fread-char-exclusive
Read a character from the command input (keyboard or macro).
It is returned as a number.  Non-character events are ignored.

If the optional argument PROMPT is non-nil, display that as a prompt.
If the optional argument INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD is non-nil and some
input method is turned on in the current buffer, that input method
is used for reading a character.

(read-char-exclusive &optional PROMPT INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD)Fget-file-char
Don't use this yourself.

(get-file-char)Fload
Execute a file of Lisp code named FILE.
First try FILE with `.elc' appended, then try with `.el',
 then try FILE unmodified.  Environment variable references in FILE
 are replaced with their values by calling `substitute-in-file-name'.
This function searches the directories in `load-path'.
If optional second arg NOERROR is non-nil,
 report no error if FILE doesn't exist.
Print messages at start and end of loading unless
 optional third arg NOMESSAGE is non-nil.
If optional fourth arg NOSUFFIX is non-nil, don't try adding
 suffixes `.elc' or `.el' to the specified name FILE.
If optional fifth arg MUST-SUFFIX is non-nil, insist on
 the suffix `.elc' or `.el'; don't accept just FILE unless
 it ends in one of those suffixes or includes a directory name.
Return t if file exists.

(load FILE &optional NOERROR NOMESSAGE NOSUFFIX MUST-SUFFIX)Feval-buffer
Execute the current buffer as Lisp code.
Programs can pass two arguments, BUFFER and PRINTFLAG.
BUFFER is the buffer to evaluate (nil means use current buffer).
PRINTFLAG controls printing of output:
nil means discard it; anything else is stream for print.

If the optional third argument FILENAME is non-nil,
it specifies the file name to use for `load-history'.
The optional fourth argument UNIBYTE specifies `load-convert-to-unibyte'
for this invocation.

The optional fifth argument DO-ALLOW-PRINT, if not-nil, specifies that
`print' and related functions should work normally even if PRINTFLAG is nil.

This function preserves the position of point.

(eval-buffer &optional BUFFER PRINTFLAG FILENAME UNIBYTE DO-ALLOW-PRINT)Feval-region
Execute the region as Lisp code.
When called from programs, expects two arguments,
giving starting and ending indices in the current buffer
of the text to be executed.
Programs can pass third argument PRINTFLAG which controls output:
nil means discard it; anything else is stream for printing it.
Also the fourth argument READ-FUNCTION, if non-nil, is used
instead of `read' to read each expression.  It gets one argument
which is the input stream for reading characters.

This function does not move point.

(eval-region START END &optional PRINTFLAG READ-FUNCTION)Fread
Read one Lisp expression as text from STREAM, return as Lisp object.
If STREAM is nil, use the value of `standard-input' (which see).
STREAM or the value of `standard-input' may be:
 a buffer (read from point and advance it)
 a marker (read from where it points and advance it)
 a function (call it with no arguments for each character,
     call it with a char as argument to push a char back)
 a string (takes text from string, starting at the beginning)
 t (read text line using minibuffer and use it, or read from
    standard input in batch mode).

(read &optional STREAM)Fread-from-string
Read one Lisp expression which is represented as text by STRING.
Returns a cons: (OBJECT-READ . FINAL-STRING-INDEX).
START and END optionally delimit a substring of STRING from which to read;
 they default to 0 and (length STRING) respectively.

(read-from-string STRING &optional START END)Fintern
Return the canonical symbol whose name is STRING.
If there is none, one is created by this function and returned.
A second optional argument specifies the obarray to use;
it defaults to the value of `obarray'.

(intern STRING &optional OBARRAY)Fintern-soft
Return the canonical symbol named NAME, or nil if none exists.
NAME may be a string or a symbol.  If it is a symbol, that exact
symbol is searched for.
A second optional argument specifies the obarray to use;
it defaults to the value of `obarray'.

(intern-soft NAME &optional OBARRAY)Funintern
Delete the symbol named NAME, if any, from OBARRAY.
The value is t if a symbol was found and deleted, nil otherwise.
NAME may be a string or a symbol.  If it is a symbol, that symbol
is deleted, if it belongs to OBARRAY--no other symbol is deleted.
OBARRAY defaults to the value of the variable `obarray'.

(unintern NAME &optional OBARRAY)Fmapatoms
Call FUNCTION on every symbol in OBARRAY.
OBARRAY defaults to the value of `obarray'.

(mapatoms FUNCTION &optional OBARRAY)Vobarray
Symbol table for use by `intern' and `read'.
It is a vector whose length ought to be prime for best results.
The vector's contents don't make sense if examined from Lisp programs;
to find all the symbols in an obarray, use `mapatoms'.Vvalues
List of values of all expressions which were read, evaluated and printed.
Order is reverse chronological.Vstandard-input
Stream for read to get input from.
See documentation of `read' for possible values.Vload-path
*List of directories to search for files to load.
Each element is a string (directory name) or nil (try default directory).
Initialized based on EMACSLOADPATH environment variable, if any,
otherwise to default specified by file `epaths.h' when Emacs was built.Vload-in-progress
Non-nil iff inside of `load'.Vafter-load-alist
An alist of expressions to be evalled when particular files are loaded.
Each element looks like (FILENAME FORMS...).
When `load' is run and the file-name argument is FILENAME,
the FORMS in the corresponding element are executed at the end of loading.

FILENAME must match exactly!  Normally FILENAME is the name of a library,
with no directory specified, since that is how `load' is normally called.
An error in FORMS does not undo the load,
but does prevent execution of the rest of the FORMS.Vload-history
Alist mapping source file names to symbols and features.
Each alist element is a list that starts with a file name,
except for one element (optional) that starts with nil and describes
definitions evaluated from buffers not visiting files.
The remaining elements of each list are symbols defined as functions
or variables, and cons cells `(provide . FEATURE)', `(require . FEATURE)',
and `(autoload . SYMBOL)'.Vload-file-name
Full name of file being loaded by `load'.Vuser-init-file
File name, including directory, of user's initialization file.
If the file loaded had extension `.elc' and there was a corresponding `.el'
file, this variable contains the name of the .el file, suitable for use
by functions like `custom-save-all' which edit the init file.Vcurrent-load-list
Used for internal purposes by `load'.Vload-read-function
Function used by `load' and `eval-region' for reading expressions.
The default is nil, which means use the function `read'.Vload-source-file-function
Function called in `load' for loading an Emacs lisp source file.
This function is for doing code conversion before reading the source file.
If nil, loading is done without any code conversion.
Arguments are FULLNAME, FILE, NOERROR, NOMESSAGE, where
 FULLNAME is the full name of FILE.
See `load' for the meaning of the remaining arguments.Vload-force-doc-strings
Non-nil means `load' should force-load all dynamic doc strings.
This is useful when the file being loaded is a temporary copy.Vload-convert-to-unibyte
Non-nil means `read' converts strings to unibyte whenever possible.
This is normally bound by `load' and `eval-buffer' to control `read',
and is not meant for users to change.Vsource-directory
Directory in which Emacs sources were found when Emacs was built.
You cannot count on them to still be there!Vpreloaded-file-list
List of files that were preloaded (when dumping Emacs).Vbyte-boolean-vars
List of all DEFVAR_BOOL variables, used by the byte code optimizer.Vload-dangerous-libraries
Non-nil means load dangerous compiled Lisp files.
Some versions of XEmacs use different byte codes than Emacs.  These
incompatible byte codes can make Emacs crash when it tries to execute
them.Vbytecomp-version-regexp
Regular expression matching safe to load compiled Lisp files.
When Emacs loads a compiled Lisp file, it reads the first 512 bytes
from the file, and matches them against this regular expression.
When the regular expression matches, the file is considered to be safe
to load.  See also `load-dangerous-libraries'.Vrecursive-load-depth-limit
Limit for depth of recursive loads.
Value should be either an integer > 0 specifying the limit, or nil for
no limit.Fmake-abbrev-table
Create a new, empty abbrev table object.

(make-abbrev-table)Fclear-abbrev-table
Undefine all abbrevs in abbrev table TABLE, leaving it empty.

(clear-abbrev-table TABLE)Fdefine-abbrev
Define an abbrev in TABLE named NAME, to expand to EXPANSION and call HOOK.
NAME must be a string.
EXPANSION should usually be a string.
To undefine an abbrev, define it with EXPANSION = nil.
If HOOK is non-nil, it should be a function of no arguments;
it is called after EXPANSION is inserted.
If EXPANSION is not a string, the abbrev is a special one,
 which does not expand in the usual way but only runs HOOK.
COUNT, if specified, initializes the abbrev's usage-count
which is incremented each time the abbrev is used.

(define-abbrev TABLE NAME EXPANSION &optional HOOK COUNT)Fdefine-global-abbrev
Define ABBREV as a global abbreviation for EXPANSION.

(define-global-abbrev ABBREV EXPANSION)Fdefine-mode-abbrev
Define ABBREV as a mode-specific abbreviation for EXPANSION.

(define-mode-abbrev ABBREV EXPANSION)Fabbrev-symbol
Return the symbol representing abbrev named ABBREV.
This symbol's name is ABBREV, but it is not the canonical symbol of that name;
it is interned in an abbrev-table rather than the normal obarray.
The value is nil if that abbrev is not defined.
Optional second arg TABLE is abbrev table to look it up in.
The default is to try buffer's mode-specific abbrev table, then global table.

(abbrev-symbol ABBREV &optional TABLE)Fabbrev-expansion
Return the string that ABBREV expands into in the current buffer.
Optionally specify an abbrev table as second arg;
then ABBREV is looked up in that table only.

(abbrev-expansion ABBREV &optional TABLE)Fexpand-abbrev
Expand the abbrev before point, if there is an abbrev there.
Effective when explicitly called even when `abbrev-mode' is nil.
Returns the abbrev symbol, if expansion took place.

(expand-abbrev)Funexpand-abbrev
Undo the expansion of the last abbrev that expanded.
This differs from ordinary undo in that other editing done since then
is not undone.

(unexpand-abbrev)Finsert-abbrev-table-description
Insert before point a full description of abbrev table named NAME.
NAME is a symbol whose value is an abbrev table.
If optional 2nd arg READABLE is non-nil, a human-readable description
is inserted.  Otherwise the description is an expression,
a call to `define-abbrev-table', which would
define the abbrev table NAME exactly as it is currently defined.

(insert-abbrev-table-description NAME &optional READABLE)Fdefine-abbrev-table
Define TABLENAME (a symbol) as an abbrev table name.
Define abbrevs in it according to DEFINITIONS, which is a list of elements
of the form (ABBREVNAME EXPANSION HOOK USECOUNT).

(define-abbrev-table TABLENAME DEFINITIONS)Vabbrev-table-name-list
List of symbols whose values are abbrev tables.Vglobal-abbrev-table
The abbrev table whose abbrevs affect all buffers.
Each buffer may also have a local abbrev table.
If it does, the local table overrides the global one
for any particular abbrev defined in both.Vfundamental-mode-abbrev-table
The abbrev table of mode-specific abbrevs for Fundamental Mode.Vlast-abbrev
The abbrev-symbol of the last abbrev expanded.  See `abbrev-symbol'.Vlast-abbrev-text
The exact text of the last abbrev expanded.
nil if the abbrev has already been unexpanded.Vlast-abbrev-location
The location of the start of the last abbrev expanded.Vabbrev-start-location
Buffer position for `expand-abbrev' to use as the start of the abbrev.
nil means use the word before point as the abbrev.
Calling `expand-abbrev' sets this to nil.Vabbrev-start-location-buffer
Buffer that `abbrev-start-location' has been set for.
Trying to expand an abbrev in any other buffer clears `abbrev-start-location'.Vlocal-abbrev-table
Local (mode-specific) abbrev table of current buffer.Vabbrevs-changed
Set non-nil by defining or altering any word abbrevs.
This causes `save-some-buffers' to offer to save the abbrevs.Vabbrev-all-caps
*Set non-nil means expand multi-word abbrevs all caps if abbrev was so.Vpre-abbrev-expand-hook
Function or functions to be called before abbrev expansion is done.
This is the first thing that `expand-abbrev' does, and so this may change
the current abbrev table before abbrev lookup happens.Fsyntax-table-p
Return t if OBJECT is a syntax table.
Currently, any char-table counts as a syntax table.

(syntax-table-p OBJECT)Fsyntax-table
Return the current syntax table.
This is the one specified by the current buffer.

(syntax-table)Fstandard-syntax-table
Return the standard syntax table.
This is the one used for new buffers.

(standard-syntax-table)Fcopy-syntax-table
Construct a new syntax table and return it.
It is a copy of the TABLE, which defaults to the standard syntax table.

(copy-syntax-table &optional TABLE)Fset-syntax-table
Select a new syntax table for the current buffer.
One argument, a syntax table.

(set-syntax-table TABLE)Fchar-syntax
Return the syntax code of CHARACTER, described by a character.
For example, if CHARACTER is a word constituent,
the character `w' is returned.
The characters that correspond to various syntax codes
are listed in the documentation of `modify-syntax-entry'.

(char-syntax CHARACTER)Fmatching-paren
Return the matching parenthesis of CHARACTER, or nil if none.

(matching-paren CHARACTER)Fstring-to-syntax
Convert a syntax specification STRING into syntax cell form.
STRING should be a string as it is allowed as argument of
`modify-syntax-entry'.  Value is the equivalent cons cell
(CODE . MATCHING-CHAR) that can be used as value of a `syntax-table'
text property.

(string-to-syntax STRING)Fmodify-syntax-entry
Set syntax for character CHAR according to string S.
The syntax is changed only for table TABLE, which defaults to
 the current buffer's syntax table.
The first character of S should be one of the following:
  Space or -  whitespace syntax.    w   word constituent.
  _           symbol constituent.   .   punctuation.
  (           open-parenthesis.     )   close-parenthesis.
  "           string quote.         \   escape.
  $           paired delimiter.     '   expression quote or prefix operator.
  <           comment starter.      >   comment ender.
  /           character-quote.      @   inherit from `standard-syntax-table'.
  |           generic string fence. !   generic comment fence.

Only single-character comment start and end sequences are represented thus.
Two-character sequences are represented as described below.
The second character of S is the matching parenthesis,
 used only if the first character is `(' or `)'.
Any additional characters are flags.
Defined flags are the characters 1, 2, 3, 4, b, p, and n.
 1 means CHAR is the start of a two-char comment start sequence.
 2 means CHAR is the second character of such a sequence.
 3 means CHAR is the start of a two-char comment end sequence.
 4 means CHAR is the second character of such a sequence.

There can be up to two orthogonal comment sequences.  This is to support
language modes such as C++.  By default, all comment sequences are of style
a, but you can set the comment sequence style to b (on the second character
of a comment-start, or the first character of a comment-end sequence) using
this flag:
 b means CHAR is part of comment sequence b.
 n means CHAR is part of a nestable comment sequence.

 p means CHAR is a prefix character for `backward-prefix-chars';
   such characters are treated as whitespace when they occur
   between expressions.

(modify-syntax-entry CHAR S &optional TABLE)Fdescribe-syntax
Describe the syntax specifications in the syntax table.
The descriptions are inserted in a buffer, which is then displayed.

(describe-syntax)Fforward-word
Move point forward ARG words (backward if ARG is negative).
Normally returns t.
If an edge of the buffer or a field boundary is reached, point is left there
and the function returns nil.  Field boundaries are not noticed if
`inhibit-field-text-motion' is non-nil.

(forward-word COUNT)Fskip-chars-forward
Move point forward, stopping before a char not in STRING, or at pos LIM.
STRING is like the inside of a `[...]' in a regular expression
except that `]' is never special and `\' quotes `^', `-' or `\'
 (but not as the end of a range; quoting is never needed there).
Thus, with arg "a-zA-Z", this skips letters stopping before first nonletter.
With arg "^a-zA-Z", skips nonletters stopping before first letter.
Returns the distance traveled, either zero or positive.

(skip-chars-forward STRING &optional LIM)Fskip-chars-backward
Move point backward, stopping after a char not in STRING, or at pos LIM.
See `skip-chars-forward' for details.
Returns the distance traveled, either zero or negative.

(skip-chars-backward STRING &optional LIM)Fskip-syntax-forward
Move point forward across chars in specified syntax classes.
SYNTAX is a string of syntax code characters.
Stop before a char whose syntax is not in SYNTAX, or at position LIM.
If SYNTAX starts with ^, skip characters whose syntax is NOT in SYNTAX.
This function returns the distance traveled, either zero or positive.

(skip-syntax-forward SYNTAX &optional LIM)Fskip-syntax-backward
Move point backward across chars in specified syntax classes.
SYNTAX is a string of syntax code characters.
Stop on reaching a char whose syntax is not in SYNTAX, or at position LIM.
If SYNTAX starts with ^, skip characters whose syntax is NOT in SYNTAX.
This function returns the distance traveled, either zero or negative.

(skip-syntax-backward SYNTAX &optional LIM)Fforward-comment
Move forward across up to N comments.  If N is negative, move backward.
Stop scanning if we find something other than a comment or whitespace.
Set point to where scanning stops.
If N comments are found as expected, with nothing except whitespace
between them, return t; otherwise return nil.

(forward-comment COUNT)Fscan-lists
Scan from character number FROM by COUNT lists.
Returns the character number of the position thus found.

If DEPTH is nonzero, paren depth begins counting from that value,
only places where the depth in parentheses becomes zero
are candidates for stopping; COUNT such places are counted.
Thus, a positive value for DEPTH means go out levels.

Comments are ignored if `parse-sexp-ignore-comments' is non-nil.

If the beginning or end of (the accessible part of) the buffer is reached
and the depth is wrong, an error is signaled.
If the depth is right but the count is not used up, nil is returned.

(scan-lists FROM COUNT DEPTH)Fscan-sexps
Scan from character number FROM by COUNT balanced expressions.
If COUNT is negative, scan backwards.
Returns the character number of the position thus found.

Comments are ignored if `parse-sexp-ignore-comments' is non-nil.

If the beginning or end of (the accessible part of) the buffer is reached
in the middle of a parenthetical grouping, an error is signaled.
If the beginning or end is reached between groupings
but before count is used up, nil is returned.

(scan-sexps FROM COUNT)Fbackward-prefix-chars
Move point backward over any number of chars with prefix syntax.
This includes chars with "quote" or "prefix" syntax (' or p).

(backward-prefix-chars)Fparse-partial-sexp
Parse Lisp syntax starting at FROM until TO; return status of parse at TO.
Parsing stops at TO or when certain criteria are met;
 point is set to where parsing stops.
If fifth arg STATE is omitted or nil,
 parsing assumes that FROM is the beginning of a function.
Value is a list of ten elements describing final state of parsing:
 0. depth in parens.
 1. character address of start of innermost containing list; nil if none.
 2. character address of start of last complete sexp terminated.
 3. non-nil if inside a string.
    (it is the character that will terminate the string,
     or t if the string should be terminated by a generic string delimiter.)
 4. nil if outside a comment, t if inside a non-nestable comment, 
    else an integer (the current comment nesting).
 5. t if following a quote character.
 6. the minimum paren-depth encountered during this scan.
 7. t if in a comment of style b; symbol `syntax-table' if the comment
    should be terminated by a generic comment delimiter.
 8. character address of start of comment or string; nil if not in one.
 9. Intermediate data for continuation of parsing (subject to change).
If third arg TARGETDEPTH is non-nil, parsing stops if the depth
in parentheses becomes equal to TARGETDEPTH.
Fourth arg STOPBEFORE non-nil means stop when come to
 any character that starts a sexp.
Fifth arg STATE is a nine-element list like what this function returns.
 It is used to initialize the state of the parse.  Elements number 1, 2, 6
 and 8 are ignored; you can leave off element 8 (the last) entirely.
Sixth arg COMMENTSTOP non-nil means stop at the start of a comment.
 If it is symbol `syntax-table', stop after the start of a comment or a
 string, or after end of a comment or a string.

(parse-partial-sexp FROM TO &optional TARGETDEPTH STOPBEFORE STATE COMMENTSTOP)Vparse-sexp-ignore-comments
Non-nil means `forward-sexp', etc., should treat comments as whitespace.Vparse-sexp-lookup-properties
Non-nil means `forward-sexp', etc., grant `syntax-table' property.
The value of this property should be either a syntax table, or a cons
of the form (SYNTAXCODE . MATCHCHAR), SYNTAXCODE being the numeric
syntax code, MATCHCHAR being nil or the character to match (which is
relevant only for open/close type.Vwords-include-escapes
Non-nil means `forward-word', etc., should treat escape chars part of words.Vmultibyte-syntax-as-symbol
Non-nil means `scan-sexps' treats all multibyte characters as symbol.Vopen-paren-in-column-0-is-defun-start
Non-nil means an open paren in column 0 denotes the start of a defun.Fml-if

Return a substring of STRING, starting at index FROM and of length LENGTH.
If either FROM or LENGTH is negative, the length of STRING is added to it.

(ml-substr STRING FROM TO)Finsert-string
Mocklisp-compatibility insert function.
Like the function `insert' except that any argument that is a number
is converted into a string by expressing it in decimal.Fbyte-code
Function used internally in byte-compiled code.
The first argument, BYTESTR, is a string of byte code;
the second, VECTOR, a vector of constants;
the third, MAXDEPTH, the maximum stack depth used in this function.
If the third argument is incorrect, Emacs may crash.

(byte-code BYTESTR VECTOR MAXDEPTH)Vbyte-code-meter
A vector of vectors which holds a histogram of byte-code usage.
(aref (aref byte-code-meter 0) CODE) indicates how many times the byte
opcode CODE has been executed.
(aref (aref byte-code-meter CODE1) CODE2), where CODE1 is not 0,
indicates how many times the byte opcodes CODE1 and CODE2 have been
executed in succession.Vbyte-metering-on
If non-nil, keep profiling information on byte code usage.
The variable byte-code-meter indicates how often each byte opcode is used.
If a symbol has a property named `byte-code-meter' whose value is an
integer, it is incremented each time that symbol's function is called.Fprocessp
Return t if OBJECT is a process.

(processp OBJECT)Fget-process
Return the process named NAME, or nil if there is none.

(get-process NAME)Fget-buffer-process

PROCESS may be a process, a buffer, the name of a process or buffer, or
nil, indicating the current buffer's process.

(delete-process PROCESS)Fprocess-status
Return the status of PROCESS.
The returned value is one of the following symbols:
run  -- for a process that is running.
stop -- for a process stopped but continuable.
exit -- for a process that has exited.
signal -- for a process that has got a fatal signal.
open -- for a network stream connection that is open.
closed -- for a network stream connection that is closed.

Return the name of PROCESS, as a string.
This is the name of the program invoked in PROCESS,
possibly modified to make it unique among process names.

(process-name PROCESS)Fprocess-command
Return the command that was executed to start PROCESS.
This is a list of strings, the first string being the program executed
and the rest of the strings being the arguments given to it.
For a non-child channel, this is nil.

(process-command PROCESS)Fprocess-tty-name
Return the name of the terminal PROCESS uses, or nil if none.
This is the terminal that the process itself reads and writes on,
not the name of the pty that Emacs uses to talk with that terminal.

(process-tty-name PROCESS)Fset-process-buffer
Set buffer associated with PROCESS to BUFFER (a buffer, or nil).

(set-process-buffer PROCESS BUFFER)Fprocess-buffer

Give PROCESS the filter function FILTER; nil means no filter.
t means stop accepting output from the process.
When a process has a filter, each time it does output
the entire string of output is passed to the filter.
The filter gets two arguments: the process and the string of output.
If the process has a filter, its buffer is not used for output.

(set-process-filter PROCESS FILTER)Fprocess-filter
Returns the filter function of PROCESS; nil if none.
See `set-process-filter' for more info on filter functions.

Tell PROCESS that it has logical window size HEIGHT and WIDTH.

(set-process-window-size PROCESS HEIGHT WIDTH)Fset-process-inherit-coding-system-flag
Determine whether buffer of PROCESS will inherit coding-system.
If the second argument FLAG is non-nil, then the variable
`buffer-file-coding-system' of the buffer associated with PROCESS
will be bound to the value of the coding system used to decode
the process output.

This is useful when the coding system specified for the process buffer
leaves either the character code conversion or the end-of-line conversion
unspecified, or if the coding system used to decode the process output
is more appropriate for saving the process buffer.

Binding the variable `inherit-process-coding-system' to non-nil before
starting the process is an alternative way of setting the inherit flag
for the process which will run.

(set-process-inherit-coding-system-flag PROCESS FLAG)Fprocess-inherit-coding-system-flag
Return the value of inherit-coding-system flag for PROCESS.

Set the region to the text dragged over, and copy to kill ring.
This should be bound to a mouse drag event.Vmouse-scroll-delay
*The pause between scroll steps caused by mouse drags, in seconds.
If you drag the mouse beyond the edge of a window, Emacs scrolls the
window to bring the text beyond that edge into view, with a delay of
this many seconds between scroll steps.  Scrolling stops when you move
the mouse back into the window, or release the button.
This variable's value may be non-integral.
Setting this to zero causes Emacs to scroll as fast as it can.Vmouse-scroll-min-lines
*The minimum number of lines scrolled by dragging mouse out of window.
Moving the mouse out the top or bottom edge of the window begins
scrolling repeatedly.  The number of lines scrolled per repetition
is normally equal to the number of lines beyond the window edge that
the mouse has moved.  However, it always scrolls at least the number
of lines specified by this variable.Fmouse-scroll-subr
Scroll the window WINDOW, JUMP lines at a time, until new input arrives.
If OVERLAY is an overlay, let it stretch from START to the far edge of
the newly visible text.
Upon exit, point is at the far edge of the newly visible text.Fmouse-drag-region
Set the region to the text that the mouse is dragged over.

Insert the last stretch of killed text at the position clicked on.
Also move point to one end of the text thus inserted (normally the end),
and set mark at the beginning..
Prefix arguments are interpreted as with \[yank].
If `mouse-yank-at-point' is non-nil, insert at point
regardless of where you click.Fmouse-kill-ring-save
Copy the region between point and the mouse click in the kill ring.
This does not delete the region; it acts like \[kill-ring-save].Fmouse-save-then-kill
Save text to point in kill ring; the second time, kill the text.
If the text between point and the mouse is the same as what's
at the front of the kill ring, this deletes the text.
Otherwise, it adds the text to the kill ring, like \[kill-ring-save],
which prepares for a second click to delete the text.

If you have selected words or lines, this command extends the
selection through the word or line clicked on.  If you do this
again in a different position, it extends the selection again.
If you do this twice in the same position, the selection is killed.Fmouse-start-secondary
Set one end of the secondary selection to the position clicked on.
Use \[mouse-secondary-save-then-kill] to set the other end
and complete the secondary selection.Fmouse-set-secondary
Set the secondary selection to the text that the mouse is dragged over.
This must be bound to a mouse drag event.Fmouse-drag-secondary
Set the secondary selection to the text that the mouse is dragged over.
Highlight the drag area as you move the mouse.
This must be bound to a button-down mouse event.
The function returns a non-nil value if it creates a secondary selection.Fmouse-yank-secondary
Insert the secondary selection at the position clicked on.
Move point to the end of the inserted text.
If `mouse-yank-at-point' is non-nil, insert at point
regardless of where you click.Fmouse-kill-secondary
Kill the text in the secondary selection.
This is intended more as a keyboard command than as a mouse command
but it can work as either one.

The current buffer (in case of keyboard use), or the buffer clicked on,
must be the one that the secondary selection is in.  This requirement
is to prevent accidents.Fmouse-secondary-save-then-kill
Save text to point in kill ring; the second time, kill the text.
You must use this in a buffer where you have recently done \[mouse-start-secondary].
If the text between where you did \[mouse-start-secondary] and where
you use this command matches the text at the front of the kill ring,
this command deletes the text.
Otherwise, it adds the text to the kill ring, like \[kill-ring-save],
which prepares for a second click with this command to delete the text.

If you have already made a secondary selection in that buffer,
this command extends or retracts the selection to where you click.
If you do this again in a different position, it extends or retracts
again.  If you do this twice in the same position, it kills the selection.Vmouse-buffer-menu-maxlen
*Number of buffers in one pane (submenu) of the buffer menu.
If we have lots of buffers, divide them into groups of
`mouse-buffer-menu-maxlen' and make a pane (or submenu) for each one.Vmouse-buffer-menu-mode-mult
*Group the buffers by the major mode groups on \[mouse-buffer-menu]?
This number which determines (in a hairy way) whether \[mouse-buffer-menu]
will split the buffer menu by the major modes (see
`mouse-buffer-menu-mode-groups') or just by menu length.
Set to 1 (or even 0!) if you want to group by major mode always, and to
a large number if you prefer a mixed multitude.  The default is 4.Vmouse-buffer-menu-mode-groups
How to group various major modes together in \[mouse-buffer-menu].
Each element has the form (REGEXP . GROUPNAME).
If the major mode's name string matches REGEXP, use GROUPNAME instead.Fmouse-buffer-menu
Pop up a menu of buffers for selection with the mouse.
This switches buffers in the window that you clicked on,
and selects that window.Fmouse-choose-completion
Click on an alternative in the `*Completions*' buffer to choose it.Vx-fixed-font-alist
X fonts suitable for use in Emacs.Fmouse-set-font
Select an emacs font from a list of known good fonts and fontsets.Fx-get-selection
Return the value of an X Windows selection.
The argument TYPE (default `PRIMARY') says which selection, 
and the argument DATA-TYPE (default `STRING') says
how to convert the data.

TYPE may be `SECONDARY' or `CLIPBOARD', in addition to `PRIMARY'.
DATA-TYPE is usually `STRING', but can also be one of the symbols
in `selection-converter-alist', which see.Fx-get-clipboard
Return text pasted to the clipboard.Fx-set-selection
Make an X Windows selection of type TYPE and value DATA.
The argument TYPE (default `PRIMARY') says which selection, 
and DATA specifies the contents.  DATA may be a string,
a symbol, an integer (or a cons of two integers or list of two integers).

The selection may also be a cons of two markers pointing to the same buffer,
or an overlay.  In these cases, the selection is considered to be the text 
between the markers *at whatever time the selection is examined*.
Thus, editing done in the buffer after you specify the selection
can alter the effective value of the selection.

The data may also be a vector of valid non-vector selection values.

Interactively, the text of the region is used as the selection value
if the prefix arg is set.Fx-get-cut-buffer
Returns the value of one of the 8 X server cut-buffers.  Optional arg
WHICH-ONE should be a number from 0 to 7, defaulting to 0.
Cut buffers are considered obsolete; you should use selections instead.Fx-set-cut-buffer
Store STRING into the X server's primary cut buffer.
If PUSH is non-nil, also rotate the cut buffers:
this means the previous value of the primary cut buffer moves the second
cut buffer, and the second to the third, and so on (there are 8 buffers.)
Cut buffers are considered obsolete; you should use selections instead.Fxselect-convert-to-class
EmacsFxselect-convert-to-name
emacsFscroll-bar-event-ratio
Given a scroll bar event EVENT, return the scroll bar position as a ratio.
The value is a cons cell (PORTION . WHOLE) containing two integers
whose ratio gives the event's vertical position in the scroll bar, with 0
referring to the top and 1 to the bottom.Fscroll-bar-scale
Given a pair (NUM . DENOM) and WHOLE, return (/ (* NUM WHOLE) DENOM).
This is handy for scaling a position on a scroll bar into real units,
like buffer positions.  If SCROLL-BAR-POS is the (PORTION . WHOLE) pair
from a scroll bar event, then (scroll-bar-scale SCROLL-BAR-POS
(buffer-size)) is the position in the current buffer corresponding to
that scroll bar position.Vscroll-bar-mode-explicit
Non-nil means `set-scroll-bar-mode' should really do something.
This is nil while loading `scroll-bar.el', and t afterward.Fset-scroll-bar-mode
Set `scroll-bar-mode' to VALUE and put the new value into effect.Vscroll-bar-mode
*Specify whether to have vertical scroll bars, and on which side.
Possible values are nil (no scroll bars), `left' (scroll bars on left)
and `right' (scroll bars on right).
To set this variable in a Lisp program, use `set-scroll-bar-mode'
to make it take real effect.
Setting the variable with a customization buffer also takes effect.Fscroll-bar-mode
Toggle display of vertical scroll bars on all frames.
This command applies to all frames that exist and frames to be
created in the future.
With a numeric argument, if the argument is negative,
turn off scroll bars; otherwise, turn on scroll bars.Ftoggle-scroll-bar
Toggle whether or not the selected frame has vertical scroll bars.
With arg, turn vertical scroll bars on if and only if arg is positive.
The variable `scroll-bar-mode' controls which side the scroll bars are on
when they are turned on; if it is nil, they go on the left.Ftoggle-horizontal-scroll-bar
Toggle whether or not the selected frame has horizontal scroll bars.
With arg, turn horizontal scroll bars on if and only if arg is positive.
Horizontal scroll bars aren't implemented yet.Fscroll-bar-set-window-start
Set the window start according to where the scroll bar is dragged.
EVENT should be a scroll bar click or drag event.Fscroll-bar-drag-position
Calculate new window start for drag event.Fscroll-bar-maybe-set-window-start
Set the window start according to where the scroll bar is dragged.
Only change window start if the new start is substantially different.
EVENT should be a scroll bar click or drag event.Fscroll-bar-drag
Scroll the window by dragging the scroll bar slider.
If you click outside the slider, the window scrolls to bring the slider there.Fscroll-bar-scroll-down
Scroll the window's top line down to the location of the scroll bar click.
EVENT should be a scroll bar click.Fscroll-bar-scroll-up
Scroll the line next to the scroll bar click to the top of the window.
EVENT should be a scroll bar click.Vdisplay-subprocess-window
If non-nil, the subprocess window is displayed whenever input is received.Vcommand-prefix-string
String to insert to distinguish commands entered by user.Fsubprocess-input
Handles input from a subprocess.  Called by Emacs.Fsubprocess-exit
Called by Emacs upon subprocess exit.Fstart-subprocess
Spawns an asynchronous subprocess with output redirected to
the buffer *COMMAND*.  Within this buffer, use C-m to send
the last line to the subprocess or to bring another line to
the end.Fsubprocess-command-to-buffer
Execute COMMAND and redirect output into BUFFER.Fsubprocess-command
Starts asynchronous subprocess if not running and switches to its window.Fcommand-send-input
If at last line of buffer, sends the current line to
the spawned subprocess.  Otherwise brings back current
line to the last line for resubmission.Fcommand-kill-line
Kills the current line.  Used in command mode.Fcreate-file-buffer
Create a suitably named buffer for visiting FILENAME, and return it.
FILENAME (sans directory) is used unchanged if that name is free;
otherwise a string <2> or <3> or ... is appended to get an unused name.Fmake-auto-save-file-name
Return file name to use for auto-saves of current buffer.
This function does not consider `auto-save-visited-file-name';
the caller should check that before calling this function.
This is a separate function so that your `.emacs' file or the site's
`site-init.el' can redefine it.
See also `auto-save-file-name-p'.Fauto-save-file-name-p
Return t if FILENAME can be yielded by `make-auto-save-file-name'.
FILENAME should lack slashes.
This is a separate function so that your `.emacs' file or the site's
`site-init.el' can redefine it.Fvms-suspend-resume-hook
When resuming suspended Emacs, check for file to be found.
If the logical name `EMACS_FILE_NAME' is defined, `find-file' that file.Fvms-suspend-hook
Don't allow suspending if logical name `DONT_SUSPEND_EMACS' is defined.Fvms-command-line-again
Reprocess command line arguments.  VMS specific.
Command line arguments are initialized from the logical EMACS_COMMAND_ARGS
which is defined by kepteditor.com.  On VMS this allows attaching to a
spawned Emacs and doing things like "emacs -l myfile.el -f doit"Fvms-pmail-setup
Set up file assuming use by VMS Mail utility.
The buffer is put into text-mode, auto-save is turned off and the
following bindings are established.

\[vms-pmail-save-and-exit]	vms-pmail-save-and-exit
\[vms-pmail-abort]	vms-pmail-abort

All other Emacs commands are still available.Vls-lisp-emulation
*Platform to emulate: GNU (default), MacOS, MS-Windows, UNIX.
Corresponding value is one of the atoms: nil, MacOS, MS-Windows, UNIX.
Sets default values for: `ls-lisp-ignore-case', `ls-lisp-dirs-first',
`ls-lisp-verbosity'.  Need not match actual platform.  Changing this
option will have no effect until you restart Emacs.Vls-lisp-ignore-case
*Non-nil causes ls-lisp alphabetic sorting to ignore case.Vls-lisp-dirs-first
*Non-nil causes ls-lisp to sort directories first in any ordering.
(Or last if it is reversed.)  Follows Microsoft Windows Explorer.Vls-lisp-verbosity
*A list of optional file attributes that ls-lisp should display.
It should contain none or more of the symbols: links, uid, gid.
Nil (or an empty list) means display none of them.

Concepts come from UNIX: `links' means count of names associated with
the file; `uid' means user (owner) identifier; `gid' means group
identifier.

If emulation is MacOS then default is nil;
if emulation is MS-Windows then default is `(links)' if platform is
Windows NT/2K, nil otherwise;
if emulation is UNIX then default is `(links uid)';
if emulation is GNU then default is `(links uid gid)'.Vls-lisp-use-insert-directory-program
*Non-nil causes ls-lisp to revert back to using `insert-directory-program'.
This is useful on platforms where ls-lisp is dumped into Emacs, such as
Microsoft Windows, but you would still like to use a program to list
the contents of a directory.Vls-lisp-support-shell-wildcards
*Non-nil means ls-lisp treats file patterns as shell wildcards.
Otherwise they are treated as Emacs regexps (for backward compatibility).Fls-lisp-parse-symlink
This stub may be redefined to parse FILE-NAME as a symlink.
It should return nil or the link target as a string.Finsert-directory
Insert directory listing for FILE, formatted according to SWITCHES.
Leaves point after the inserted text.
SWITCHES may be a string of options, or a list of strings.
Optional third arg WILDCARD means treat FILE as shell wildcard.
Optional fourth arg FULL-DIRECTORY-P means file is a directory and
switches do not contain `d', so that a full listing is expected.

This version of the function comes from `ls-lisp.el'.
If the value of `ls-lisp-use-insert-directory-program' is non-nil then
it works exactly like the version from `files.el' and runs a directory
listing program whose name is in the variable
`insert-directory-program'; if also WILDCARD is non-nil then it runs
the shell specified by `shell-file-name'.  If the value of
`ls-lisp-use-insert-directory-program' is nil then it runs a Lisp
emulation.

The Lisp emulation does not run any external programs or shells.  It
supports ordinary shell wildcards if `ls-lisp-support-shell-wildcards'
is non-nil; otherwise, it interprets wildcards as regular expressions
to match file names.  It does not support all `ls' switches -- those
that work are: A a c i r S s t u U X g G B C R and F partly.Fls-lisp-insert-directory
Insert directory listing for FILE, formatted according to SWITCHES.
Leaves point after the inserted text.  This is an internal function
optionally called by the `ls-lisp.el' version of `insert-directory'.
It is called recursively if the -R switch is used.
SWITCHES is a *list* of characters.  TIME-INDEX is the time index into
file-attributes according to SWITCHES.  WILDCARD is nil or an *Emacs
regexp*.  FULL-DIRECTORY-P means file is a directory and SWITCHES does
not contain `d', so that a full listing is expected.Fls-lisp-column-format
Insert the file names (only) in FILE-ALIST into the current buffer.
Format in columns, sorted vertically, following GNU ls -C.
Responds to the window width as ls should but may not!Fls-lisp-delete-matching
Delete all elements matching REGEXP from LIST, return new list.Fls-lisp-string-lessp
Return t if string S1 is less than string S2 in lexicographic order.
Case is significant if `ls-lisp-ignore-case' is nil.
Unibyte strings are converted to multibyte for comparison.Fls-lisp-handle-switches
Return new FILE-ALIST sorted according to SWITCHES.
SWITCHES is a list of characters.  Default sorting is alphabetic.Fls-lisp-classify
Append a character to each file name indicating the file type.
Also, for regular files that are executable, append `*'.
The file type indicators are `/' for directories, `@' for symbolic
links, `|' for FIFOs, `=' for sockets, and nothing for regular files.
[But FIFOs and sockets are not recognised.]
FILEDATA has the form (filename . `file-attributes').  Its `cadr' is t
for directory, string (name linked to) for symbolic link, or nil.Fls-lisp-extension
Return extension of FILENAME (ignoring any version extension)
FOLLOWED by null and full filename, SOLELY for full alpha sort.Fls-lisp-time-lessp
Return t if time TIME0 is earlier than time TIME1.Fls-lisp-format
Format one line of long ls output for file FILE-NAME.
FILE-ATTR and FILE-SIZE give the file's attributes and size.
SWITCHES, TIME-INDEX and NOW give the full switch list and time data.Fls-lisp-time-index
Return time index into file-attributes according to ls SWITCHES list.
Return nil if no time switch found.Fls-lisp-format-time
Format time for file with attributes FILE-ATTR according to TIME-INDEX.
Use the same method as ls to decide whether to show time-of-day or year,
depending on distance between file date and NOW.
All ls time options, namely c, t and u, are handled.Fconvert-standard-filename
Convert a standard file's name to something suitable for the current OS.
This function's standard definition is trivial; it just returns the argument.
However, on some systems, the function is redefined
with a definition that really does change some file names.Fdos-8+3-filename
Truncate FILENAME to DOS 8+3 limits.Fmake-auto-save-file-name
Return file name to use for auto-saves of current buffer.
Does not consider `auto-save-visited-file-name' as that variable is checked
before calling this function.  You can redefine this for customization.
See also `auto-save-file-name-p'.Fmode25
Changes the number of screen rows to 25.Fmode4350
Changes the number of rows to 43 or 50.
Emacs always tries to set the screen height to 50 rows first.
If this fails, it will try to set it to 43 rows, on the assumption
that your video hardware might not support 50-line mode.Fw32-version
Return the MS-Windows version numbers.
The value is a list of three integers: the major and minor version
numbers, and the build number.Vw32-system-shells
List of strings recognized as Windows NT/9X system shells.Fw32-using-nt
Return non-nil if literally running on Windows NT (i.e., not Windows 9X).Fw32-shell-name
Return the name of the shell being used.Fw32-shell-dos-semantics
Return t if the interactive shell being used expects msdos shell semantics.Vw32-allow-system-shell
*Disable startup warning when using "system" shells.Fw32-check-shell-configuration
Check the configuration of shell variables on Windows NT/9X.
This function is invoked after loading the init files and processing
the command line arguments.  It issues a warning if the user or site
has configured the shell with inappropriate settings.Vw32-valid-locales
List of locale ids known to be supported.Fw32-list-locales
List the name and id of all locales supported by Windows.Fmake-auto-save-file-name
Return file name to use for auto-saves of current buffer.
Does not consider `auto-save-visited-file-name' as that variable is checked
before calling this function.  You can redefine this for customization.
See also `auto-save-file-name-p'.Fconvert-standard-filename
Convert a standard file's name to something suitable for the current OS.
This function's standard definition is trivial; it just returns the argument.
However, on some systems, the function is redefined
with a definition that really does change some file names.Fset-w32-system-coding-system
Set the coding system used by the Windows System to CODING-SYSTEM.
This is used for things like passing font names with non-ASCII
characters in them to the system. For a list of possible values of
CODING-SYSTEM, use \[list-coding-systems].Vw32-tty-standard-colors
A list of VGA console colors, their indices and 16-bit RGB values.Fw32-add-charset-info
Function to add character sets to display with Windows fonts.
Creates entries in `w32-charset-info-alist'.
XLFD-CHARSET is a string which will appear in the XLFD font name to
identify the character set. WINDOWS-CHARSET is a symbol identifying
the Windows character set this maps to. For the list of possible
values, see the documentation for `w32-charset-info-alist'. CODEPAGE
can be a numeric codepage that Windows uses to display the character
set, t for Unicode output with no codepage translation or nil for 8
bit output with no translation.Vx-cut-buffer-max
Max number of characters to put in the cut buffer.Vx-select-enable-clipboard
Non-nil means cutting and pasting uses the clipboard.
This is in addition to the primary selection.Fx-select-text
Make TEXT the last selected text.
If `x-select-enable-clipboard' is non-nil, copy the text to the system
clipboard as well. Optional PUSH is ignored on Windows.Fx-get-selection-value
Return the value of the current selection.
Consult the selection, then the cut buffer.  Treat empty strings as if
they were unset.Vfile-name-buffer-file-type-alist
*Alist for distinguishing text files from binary files.
Each element has the form (REGEXP . TYPE), where REGEXP is matched
against the file name, and TYPE is nil for text, t for binary.Ffind-buffer-file-type-coding-system
Choose a coding system for a file operation.
If COMMAND is `insert-file-contents', the coding system is chosen based
upon the filename, the contents of `untranslated-filesystem-list' and
`file-name-buffer-file-type-alist', and whether the file exists:

  If it matches in `untranslated-filesystem-list':
    If the file exists:					`undecided'
    If the file does not exist:				`undecided-unix'
  If it matches in `file-name-buffer-file-type-alist':
    If the match is t (for binary):			`no-conversion'
    If the match is nil (for dos-text):			`undecided-dos'
  Otherwise:
    If the file exists:					`undecided'
    If the file does not exist:	       default-buffer-file-coding-system

If COMMAND is `write-region', the coding system is chosen based upon
the value of `buffer-file-coding-system' and `buffer-file-type'. If
`buffer-file-coding-system' is non-nil, its value is used.  If it is
nil and `buffer-file-type' is t, the coding system is `no-conversion'.
Otherwise, it is `undecided-dos'.

The two most common situations are when DOS and Unix files are read
and written, and their names do not match in
`untranslated-filesystem-list' and `file-name-buffer-file-type-alist'.
In these cases, the coding system initially will be `undecided'.  As
the file is read in the DOS case, the coding system will be changed to
`undecided-dos' as CR/LFs are detected.  As the file is read in the
Unix case, the coding system will be changed to `undecided-unix' as
LFs are detected.  In both cases, `buffer-file-coding-system' will be
set to the appropriate coding system, and the value of
`buffer-file-coding-system' will be used when writing the file.Ffind-file-binary
Visit file FILENAME and treat it as binary.Ffind-file-text
Visit file FILENAME and treat it as a text file.Vuntranslated-filesystem-list
List of filesystems that require no CR/LF translation when reading 
and writing files.  Each filesystem in the list is a string naming
the directory prefix corresponding to the filesystem.Funtranslated-canonical-name
Return FILENAME in a canonicalized form for use with the functions
dealing with untranslated filesystems.Funtranslated-file-p
Return t if FILENAME is on a filesystem that does not require 
CR/LF translation, and nil otherwise.Fadd-untranslated-filesystem
Add FILESYSTEM to the list of filesystems that do not require
CR/LF translation.  FILESYSTEM is a string containing the directory
prefix corresponding to the filesystem.  For example, for a Unix 
filesystem mounted on drive Z:, FILESYSTEM could be "Z:".Fremove-untranslated-filesystem
Remove FILESYSTEM from the list of filesystems that do not require 
CR/LF translation.  FILESYSTEM is a string containing the directory
prefix corresponding to the filesystem.  For example, for a Unix 
filesystem mounted on drive Z:, FILESYSTEM could be "Z:".Vdirect-print-region-use-command-dot-com
*Control whether command.com is used to print on Windows 9x.Fdirect-print-region-function
DOS/Windows-specific function to print the region on a printer.
Writes the region to the device or file which is a value of
`printer-name' (which see), unless the value of `lpr-command'
indicates a specific program should be invoked.Fdirect-ps-print-region-function
DOS/Windows-specific function to print the region on a PostScript printer.
Writes the region to the device or file which is a value of
`ps-printer-name' (which see), unless the value of `ps-lpr-command'
indicates a specific program should be invoked.Fmake-display-table
Return a new, empty display table.Fdisplay-table-slot
Return the value of the extra slot in DISPLAY-TABLE named SLOT.
SLOT may be a number from 0 to 5 inclusive, or a slot name (symbol).
Valid symbols are `truncation', `wrap', `escape', `control',
`selective-display', and `vertical-border'.Fset-display-table-slot
Set the value of the extra slot in DISPLAY-TABLE named SLOT to VALUE.
SLOT may be a number from 0 to 5 inclusive, or a name (symbol).
Valid symbols are `truncation', `wrap', `escape', `control',
`selective-display', and `vertical-border'.Fdescribe-display-table
Describe the display table DT in a help buffer.Fdescribe-current-display-table
Describe the display table in use in the selected window and buffer.Fstandard-display-8bit
Display characters in the range L to H literally.Fstandard-display-default
Display characters in the range L to H using the default notation.Fstandard-display-ascii
Display character C using printable string S.Fstandard-display-g1
Display character C as character SC in the g1 character set.
This function assumes that your terminal uses the SO/SI characters;
it is meaningless for an X frame.Fstandard-display-graphic
Display character C as character GC in graphics character set.
This function assumes VT100-compatible escapes; it is meaningless for an
X frame.Fstandard-display-underline
Display character C as character UC plus underlining.Fcreate-glyph
Allocate a glyph code to display by sending STRING to the terminal.Fstandard-display-european
Semi-obsolete way to toggle display of ISO 8859 European characters.

This function is semi-obsolete; if you want to do your editing with
unibyte characters, it is better to `set-language-environment' coupled
with either the `--unibyte' option or the EMACS_UNIBYTE environment
variable, or else customize `enable-multibyte-characters'.

With prefix argument, this command enables European character display
if arg is positive, disables it otherwise.  Otherwise, it toggles
European character display.

When this mode is enabled, characters in the range of 160 to 255
display not as octal escapes, but as accented characters.  Codes 146
and 160 display as apostrophe and space, even though they are not the
ASCII codes for apostrophe and space.

Enabling European character display with this command noninteractively
from Lisp code also selects Latin-1 as the language environment, and
selects unibyte mode for all Emacs buffers (both existing buffers and
those created subsequently).  This provides increased compatibility
for users who call this function in `.emacs'.Vmsdos-shells
*List of shells that use `/c' instead of `-c' and a backslashed command.Vdos-codepage-setup-hook
*List of functions to be called after the DOS terminal and coding
systems are set up.  This is the place, e.g., to set specific entries
in `standard-display-table' as appropriate for your codepage, if
`IT-display-table-setup' doesn't do a perfect job.Vccl-command-table
Vector of CCL commands (symbols).Vccl-code-table
Vector of CCL compiled codes (symbols).Vccl-extended-code-table
Vector of CCL extended compiled codes (symbols).Vccl-register-table
Vector of CCL registers (symbols).Vccl-arith-table
Vector of CCL arithmetic/logical operators (symbols).Vccl-assign-arith-table
Vector of CCL assignment operators (symbols).Vccl-program-vector
Working vector of CCL codes produced by CCL compiler.Vccl-current-ic
The current index for `ccl-program-vector'.Fccl-compile
Return the compiled code of CCL-PROGRAM as a vector of integers.Fccl-dump
Disassemble compiled CCL-CODE.Fdeclare-ccl-program
Declare NAME as a name of CCL program.

This macro exists for backward compatibility.  In the old version of
Emacs, to compile a CCL program which calls another CCL program not
yet defined, it must be declared as a CCL program in advance.  But,
now CCL program names are resolved not at compile time but before
execution.

Optional arg VECTOR is a compiled CCL code of the CCL program.Fdefine-ccl-program
Set NAME the compiled code of CCL-PROGRAM.

CCL-PROGRAM has this form:
	(BUFFER_MAGNIFICATION
	 CCL_MAIN_CODE
	 [ CCL_EOF_CODE ])

BUFFER_MAGNIFICATION is an integer value specifying the approximate
output buffer magnification size compared with the bytes of input data
text.  If the value is zero, the CCL program can't execute `read' and
`write' commands.

CCL_MAIN_CODE and CCL_EOF_CODE are CCL program codes.  CCL_MAIN_CODE
executed at first.  If there's no more input data when `read' command
is executed in CCL_MAIN_CODE, CCL_EOF_CODE is executed.  If
CCL_MAIN_CODE is terminated, CCL_EOF_CODE is not executed.

Here's the syntax of CCL program code in BNF notation.  The lines
starting by two semicolons (and optional leading spaces) describe the
semantics.

CCL_MAIN_CODE := CCL_BLOCK

CCL_EOF_CODE := CCL_BLOCK

;; CCL_BLOCK_0.  Otherwise, execute CCL_BLOCK_1.
IF :=	(if EXPRESSION CCL_BLOCK_0 CCL_BLOCK_1)

;; Evaluate EXPRESSION.  Provided that the result is N, execute
;; CCL_BLOCK_N.
BRANCH := (branch EXPRESSION CCL_BLOCK_0 [CCL_BLOCK_1 ...])

;; Execute STATEMENTs until (break) or (end) is executed.
LOOP := (loop STATEMENT [STATEMENT ...])

according to your editing.
Buffer contains a header line for each abbrev table,
 which is the abbrev table name in parentheses.
This is followed by one line per abbrev in that table:
NAME   USECOUNT   EXPANSION   HOOK
where NAME and EXPANSION are strings with quotes,
USECOUNT is an integer, and HOOK is any valid function
or may be omitted (it is usually omitted).Fedit-abbrevs-redefine

The prefix argument specifies the number of words before point that form the
expansion; or zero means the region is the expansion.
A negative argument means to undefine the specified abbrev.
This command uses the minibuffer to read the abbreviation.

Don't use this function in a Lisp program; use `define-abbrev' instead.Finverse-add-mode-abbrev
Define last word before point as a mode-specific abbrev.
With prefix argument N, defines the Nth word before point.
This command uses the minibuffer to read the expansion.
Expands the abbreviation after defining it.Finverse-add-global-abbrev

Like `progn', but evaluates the body at compile time and at load time.Vcustom-define-hook
Hook called after defining each customize option.Fcustom-initialize-default
Initialize SYMBOL with VALUE.
This will do nothing if symbol already has a default binding.
Otherwise, if symbol has a `saved-value' property, it will evaluate
the car of that and used as the default binding for symbol.
Otherwise, VALUE will be evaluated and used as the default binding for
symbol.Fcustom-initialize-set
Initialize SYMBOL based on VALUE.
If the symbol doesn't have a default binding already,

Neither SYMBOL nor VALUE needs to be quoted.
If SYMBOL is not already bound, initialize it to VALUE.
The remaining arguments should have the form

   [KEYWORD VALUE]...

The following keywords are meaningful:

:type	VALUE should be a widget type for editing the symbols value.
:options VALUE should be a list of valid members of the widget type.
:group  VALUE should be a customization group.
        Add SYMBOL to that group.
:initialize
	VALUE should be a function used to initialize the
	variable.  It takes two arguments, the symbol and value
	given in the `defcustom' call.  The default is
	`custom-initialize-reset.'
:set	VALUE should be a function to set the value of the symbol.
	It takes two arguments, the symbol to set and the value to
	give it.  The default choice of function is `custom-set-default'.
:get	VALUE should be a function to extract the value of symbol.
	The function takes one argument, a symbol, and should return
	the current value for that symbol.  The default choice of function
	is `custom-default-value'.
:require
	VALUE should be a feature symbol.  If you save a value
	for this option, then when your `.emacs' file loads the value,
	it does (require VALUE) first.
:version
        VALUE should be a string specifying that the variable was
        first introduced, or its default value was changed, in Emacs
        version VERSION.
:set-after VARIABLE
	Specifies that SYMBOL should be set after VARIABLE when
	both have been customized.

Read the section about customization in the Emacs Lisp manual for more
information.Fdefface
Declare FACE as a customizable face that defaults to SPEC.
FACE does not need to be quoted.

Third argument DOC is the face documentation.

If FACE has been set with `custom-set-face', set the face attributes
as specified by that function, otherwise set the face attributes
according to SPEC.

The remaining arguments should have the form

   [KEYWORD VALUE]...

The following KEYWORDs are defined:

:group  VALUE should be a customization group.
        Add FACE to that group.

SPEC should be an alist of the form ((DISPLAY ATTS)...).

The first element of SPEC where the DISPLAY matches the frame
is the one that takes effect in that frame.  The ATTRs in this
element take effect; the other elements are ignored, on that frame.

ATTS is a list of face attributes followed by their values:
  (ATTR VALUE ATTR VALUE...)

The possible attributes are `:family', `:width', `:height', `:weight',
`:slant', `:underline', `:overline', `:strike-through', `:box',
`:foreground', `:background', `:stipple', `:inverse-video', and `:inherit'.

DISPLAY can either be the symbol t, which will match all frames, or an
alist of the form ((REQ ITEM...)...).  For the DISPLAY to match a
FRAME, the REQ property of the frame must match one of the ITEM.  The
following REQ are defined:

`type' (the value of `window-system')
  Under X, in addition to the values `window-system' can take,
  `motif', `lucid' and `x-toolkit' are allowed, and match when
  the Motif toolkit, Lucid toolkit, or any X toolkit is in use.

`class' (the frame's color support)
  Should be one of `color', `grayscale', or `mono'.

`background' (what color is used for the background text)
  Should be one of `light' or `dark'.

Read the section about customization in the Emacs Lisp manual for more
information.Fcustom-declare-group
Like `defgroup', but SYMBOL is evaluated as a normal argument.Fdefgroup
Declare SYMBOL as a customization group containing MEMBERS.
SYMBOL does not need to be quoted.

Third arg DOC is the group documentation.

MEMBERS should be an alist of the form ((NAME WIDGET)...) where
NAME is a symbol and WIDGET is a widget for editing that symbol.
Useful widgets are `custom-variable' for editing variables,
`custom-face' for edit faces, and `custom-group' for editing groups.

The remaining arguments should have the form

   [KEYWORD VALUE]...

The following KEYWORDs are defined:

:group   VALUE should be a customization group.
         Add SYMBOL to that group.

:version VALUE should be a string specifying that the group was introduced
         in Emacs version VERSION.

Read the section about customization in the Emacs Lisp manual for more
information.Fcustom-add-to-group
To existing GROUP add a new OPTION of type WIDGET.
If there already is an entry for OPTION and WIDGET, nothing is done.Fcustom-handle-all-keywords
For customization option SYMBOL, handle keyword arguments ARGS.
Third argument TYPE is the custom option type.Fcustom-handle-keyword
For customization option SYMBOL, handle KEYWORD with VALUE.
Fourth argument TYPE is the custom option type.Fcustom-add-dependencies
To the custom option SYMBOL, add dependencies specified by VALUE.
VALUE should be a list of symbols.  For each symbol in that list,
this specifies that SYMBOL should be set after the specified symbol, if
both appear in constructs like `custom-set-variables'.Fcustom-add-option
To the variable SYMBOL add OPTION.

If SYMBOL is a hook variable, OPTION should be a hook member.
For other types variables, the effect is undefined.Fcustom-add-link
To the custom option SYMBOL add the link WIDGET.Fcustom-add-version
To the custom option SYMBOL add the version VERSION.Fcustom-add-load
To the custom option SYMBOL add the dependency LOAD.
LOAD should be either a library file name, or a feature name.Vcustom-local-buffer
Non-nil, in a Customization buffer, means customize a specific buffer.
If this variable is non-nil, it should be a buffer,
and it means customize the local bindings of that buffer.
This variable is a permanent local, and it normally has a local binding
in every Customization buffer.Fcustom-set-variables
Initialize variables according to user preferences.

The arguments should be a list where each entry has the form:

  (SYMBOL VALUE [NOW [REQUEST [COMMENT]]])

The unevaluated VALUE is stored as the saved value for SYMBOL.
If NOW is present and non-nil, VALUE is also evaluated and bound as
the default value for the SYMBOL.
REQUEST is a list of features we must require for SYMBOL.
COMMENT is a comment string about SYMBOL.Fcustom-set-default
Default :set function for a customizable variable.
Normally, this sets the default value of VARIABLE to VALUE,
but if `custom-local-buffer' is non-nil,
this sets the local binding in that buffer instead.Fbackquote-list*-function
Like `list' but the last argument is the tail of the new list.

For example (backquote-list* 'a 'b 'c) => (a b . c)Fbackquote-list*-macro

Symbol used to represent an unquote inside a backquote.Vbackquote-splice-symbol
Symbol used to represent a splice inside a backquote.Fbackquote
Argument STRUCTURE describes a template to build.

The whole structure acts as if it were quoted except for certain
places where expressions are evaluated and inserted or spliced in.

For example:

b              => (ba bb bc)		; assume b has this value
`(a b c)       => (a b c)		; backquote acts like quote
`(a ,b c)      => (a (ba bb bc) c)	; insert the value of b
`(a ,@b c)     => (a ba bb bc c)	; splice in the value of b

Vectors work just like lists.  Nested backquotes are permitted.Vlisp-imenu-generic-expression
Imenu generic expression for Lisp mode.  See `imenu-generic-expression'.Flisp-outline-level
Lisp mode `outline-level' function.Vlisp-mode-shared-map
Keymap for commands shared by all sorts of Lisp modes.Vemacs-lisp-mode-map
Keymap for Emacs Lisp mode.
All commands in `lisp-mode-shared-map' are inherited by this map.Femacs-lisp-byte-compile
Byte compile the file containing the current buffer.Femacs-lisp-byte-compile-and-load
Byte-compile the current file (if it has changed), then load compiled code.Vemacs-lisp-mode-hook
Hook run when entering Emacs Lisp mode.Vlisp-mode-hook
Hook run when entering Lisp mode.Vlisp-interaction-mode-hook
Hook run when entering Lisp Interaction mode.Femacs-lisp-mode
Major mode for editing Lisp code to run in Emacs.
Commands:
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.
Blank lines separate paragraphs.  Semicolons start comments.
\{emacs-lisp-mode-map}
Entry to this mode calls the value of `emacs-lisp-mode-hook'
if that value is non-nil.Vlisp-mode-map
Keymap for ordinary Lisp mode.
All commands in `lisp-mode-shared-map' are inherited by this map.Flisp-mode
Major mode for editing Lisp code for Lisps other than GNU Emacs Lisp.
Commands:
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.
Blank lines separate paragraphs.  Semicolons start comments.
\{lisp-mode-map}
Note that `run-lisp' may be used either to start an inferior Lisp job
or to switch back to an existing one.

Entry to this mode calls the value of `lisp-mode-hook'
if that value is non-nil.Flisp-eval-defun
Send the current defun to the Lisp process made by \[run-lisp].Vlisp-interaction-mode-map
Keymap for Lisp Interaction mode.
All commands in `lisp-mode-shared-map' are inherited by this map.Flisp-interaction-mode
Major mode for typing and evaluating Lisp forms.
Like Lisp mode except that \[eval-print-last-sexp] evals the Lisp expression
before point, and prints its value into the buffer, advancing point.
Note that printing is controled by `eval-expression-print-length'
and `eval-expression-print-level'.

Commands:
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.
Paragraphs are separated only by blank lines.
Semicolons start comments.
\{lisp-interaction-mode-map}
Entry to this mode calls the value of `lisp-interaction-mode-hook'
if that value is non-nil.Feval-print-last-sexp
Evaluate sexp before point; print value into current buffer.

Note that printing the result is controlled by the variables
`eval-expression-print-length' and `eval-expression-print-level',
which see.Flast-sexp-setup-props
Set up text properties for the output of `eval-last-sexp-1'.
BEG and END are the start and end of the output in current-buffer.
VALUE is the Lisp value printed, ALT1 and ALT2 are strings for the 
alternative printed representations that can be displayed.Flast-sexp-toggle-display
Toggle between abbreviated and unabbreviated printed representations.Feval-last-sexp-1
Evaluate sexp before point; print value in minibuffer.
With argument, print output into current buffer.Feval-last-sexp
Evaluate sexp before point; print value in minibuffer.
Interactively, with prefix argument, print output into current buffer.Feval-defun-1
Change defvar into defconst within FORM.
Likewise for other constructs as necessary.Feval-defun-2
Evaluate defun that point is in or before.
The value is displayed in the minibuffer.
If the current defun is actually a call to `defvar',
then reset the variable using the initial value expression
even if the variable already has some other value.
(Normally `defvar' does not change the variable's value
if it already has a value.)

With argument, insert value in current buffer after the defun.
Return the result of evaluation.Feval-defun
Evaluate the top-level form containing point, or after point.

If the current defun is actually a call to `defvar' or `defcustom',
evaluating it this way resets the variable using its initial value
expression even if the variable already has some other value.
(Normally `defvar' and `defcustom' do not alter the value if there
already is one.)

With a prefix argument, instrument the code for Edebug.

If acting on a `defun' for FUNCTION, and the function was
instrumented, `Edebug: FUNCTION' is printed in the minibuffer.  If not
instrumented, just FUNCTION is printed.

If not acting on a `defun', the result of evaluation is displayed in
the minibuffer.  This display is controlled by the variables
`eval-expression-print-length' and `eval-expression-print-level',
which see.Vlisp-indent-offset
If non-nil, indent second line of expressions that many more columns.Flisp-indent-line
Indent current line as Lisp code.
With argument, indent any additional lines of the same expression
rigidly along with this one.Fcalculate-lisp-indent
Return appropriate indentation for current line as Lisp code.
In usual case returns an integer: the column to indent to.
If the value is nil, that means don't change the indentation
because the line starts inside a string.

The value can also be a list of the form (COLUMN CONTAINING-SEXP-START).
This means that following lines at the same level of indentation
should not necessarily be indented the same as this line.
Then COLUMN is the column to indent to, and CONTAINING-SEXP-START
is the buffer position of the start of the containing expression.Vlisp-body-indent
Number of columns to indent the second line of a `(def...)' form.Findent-sexp
Indent each line of the list starting just after point.
If optional arg ENDPOS is given, indent each line, stopping when
ENDPOS is encountered.Flisp-indent-region
Indent every line whose first char is between START and END inclusive.Flisp-fill-paragraph
Like \[fill-paragraph], but handle Emacs Lisp comments.
If any of the current line is a comment, fill the comment or the
paragraph of it that point is in, preserving the comment's indentation
and initial semicolons.Findent-code-rigidly
Indent all lines of code, starting in the region, sideways by ARG columns.
Does not affect lines starting inside comments or strings, assuming that
the start of the region is not inside them.

Called from a program, takes args START, END, COLUMNS and NOCHANGE-REGEXP.
The last is a regexp which, if matched at the beginning of a line,
means don't indent that line.Vdefun-prompt-regexp
*If non-nil, a regexp to ignore before the character that starts a defun.
This is only necessary if the opening paren or brace is not in column 0.
See function `beginning-of-defun'.

Setting this variable automatically makes it local to the current buffer.Vparens-require-spaces
Non-nil means `insert-parentheses' should insert whitespace as needed.Vforward-sexp-function
If non-nil, `forward-sexp' delegates to this function.
Should take the same arguments and behave similarly to `forward-sexp'.Fforward-sexp
Move forward across one balanced expression (sexp).
With ARG, do it that many times.  Negative arg -N means
move backward across N balanced expressions.Fbackward-sexp
Move backward across one balanced expression (sexp).
With ARG, do it that many times.  Negative arg -N means
move forward across N balanced expressions.Fmark-sexp
Set mark ARG sexps from point.
The place mark goes is the same place \[forward-sexp] would
move to with the same argument.Fforward-list
Move forward across one balanced group of parentheses.
With ARG, do it that many times.
Negative arg -N means move backward across N groups of parentheses.Fbackward-list
Move backward across one balanced group of parentheses.
With ARG, do it that many times.
Negative arg -N means move forward across N groups of parentheses.Fdown-list
Move forward down one level of parentheses.
With ARG, do this that many times.
A negative argument means move backward but still go down a level.Fbackward-up-list
Move backward out of one level of parentheses.
With ARG, do this that many times.
A negative argument means move forward but still to a less deep spot.Fup-list
Move forward out of one level of parentheses.
With ARG, do this that many times.
A negative argument means move backward but still to a less deep spot.Fkill-sexp
Kill the sexp (balanced expression) following the cursor.
With ARG, kill that many sexps after the cursor.
Negative arg -N means kill N sexps before the cursor.Fbackward-kill-sexp
Kill the sexp (balanced expression) preceding the cursor.
With ARG, kill that many sexps before the cursor.
Negative arg -N means kill N sexps after the cursor.Vbeginning-of-defun-function
If non-nil, function for `beginning-of-defun-raw' to call.
This is used to find the beginning of the defun instead of using the
normal recipe (see `beginning-of-defun').  Major modes can define this
if defining `defun-prompt-regexp' is not sufficient to handle the mode's
needs.

The function should go to the line on which the current defun starts,
and return non-nil, or should return nil if it can't find the beginning.Fbeginning-of-defun
Move backward to the beginning of a defun.
With ARG, do it that many times.  Negative arg -N
means move forward to Nth following beginning of defun.
Returns t unless search stops due to beginning or end of buffer.

Normally a defun starts when there is an char with open-parenthesis
syntax at the beginning of a line.  If `defun-prompt-regexp' is
non-nil, then a string which matches that regexp may precede the
open-parenthesis, and point ends up at the beginning of the line.

If variable `beginning-of-defun-function' is non-nil, its value
is called as a function to find the defun's beginning.Fbeginning-of-defun-raw
Move point to the character that starts a defun.
This is identical to function `beginning-of-defun', except that point
does not move to the beginning of the line when `defun-prompt-regexp'
is non-nil.

If variable `beginning-of-defun-function' is non-nil, its value
is called as a function to find the defun's beginning.Vend-of-defun-function
If non-nil, function for function `end-of-defun' to call.
This is used to find the end of the defun instead of using the normal
recipe (see `end-of-defun').  Major modes can define this if the
normal method is not appropriate.Fend-of-defun
Move forward to next end of defun.  With argument, do it that many times.
Negative argument -N means move back to Nth preceding end of defun.

An end of a defun occurs right after the close-parenthesis that
matches the open-parenthesis that starts a defun; see function
`beginning-of-defun'.

If variable `end-of-defun-function' is non-nil, its value
is called as a function to find the defun's end.Fmark-defun
Put mark at end of this defun, point at beginning.
The defun marked is the one that contains point or follows point.Fnarrow-to-defun
Make text outside current defun invisible.
The defun visible is the one that contains point or follows point.
Optional ARG is ignored.Finsert-parentheses
Enclose following ARG sexps in parentheses.  Leave point after open-paren.
A negative ARG encloses the preceding ARG sexps instead.
No argument is equivalent to zero: just insert `()' and leave point between.
If `parens-require-spaces' is non-nil, this command also inserts a space
before and after, depending on the surrounding characters.Fmove-past-close-and-reindent
Move past next `)', delete indentation before it, then indent after it.Fcheck-parens
Check for unbalanced parentheses in the current buffer.
More accurately, check the narrowed part of the buffer for unbalanced
expressions ("sexps") in general.  This is done according to the
current syntax table and will find unbalanced brackets or quotes as
appropriate.  (See Info node `(emacs)Lists and Sexps'.)  If imbalance
is found, an error is signalled and point is left at the first
unbalanced character.Flisp-complete-symbol
Perform completion on Lisp symbol preceding point.
Compare that symbol against the known Lisp symbols.

When called from a program, optional arg PREDICATE is a predicate
determining which symbols are considered, e.g. `commandp'.
If PREDICATE is nil, the context determines which symbols are
considered.  If the symbol starts just after an open-parenthesis, only
symbols with function definitions are considered.  Otherwise, all
symbols with function definitions, values or properties are
considered.Vfacemenu-keybindings
Alist of interesting faces and keybindings. 
Each element is itself a list: the car is the name of the face,
the next element is the key to use as a keyboard equivalent of the menu item;
the binding is made in `facemenu-keymap'.

The faces specifically mentioned in this list are put at the top of
the menu, in the order specified.  All other faces which are defined,
except for those in `facemenu-unlisted-faces', are listed after them, 
but get no keyboard equivalents.

If you change this variable after loading facemenu.el, you will need to call
`facemenu-update' to make it take effect.Vfacemenu-new-faces-at-end
*Where in the menu to insert newly-created faces.
This should be nil to put them at the top of the menu, or t to put them
just before "Other" at the end.Vfacemenu-unlisted-faces
*List of faces not to include in the Face menu.
Each element may be either a symbol, which is the name of a face, or a string,
which is a regular expression to be matched against face names.  Matching
faces will not be added to the menu.

You can set this list before loading facemenu.el, or add a face to it before
creating that face if you do not want it to be listed.  If you change the
variable so as to eliminate faces that have already been added to the menu,
call `facemenu-update' to recalculate the menu contents.

If this variable is t, no faces will be added to the menu.  This is useful for
temporarily turning off the feature that automatically adds faces to the menu
when they are created.Vfacemenu-face-menu
Menu keymap for faces.Vfacemenu-foreground-menu
Menu keymap for foreground colors.Vfacemenu-background-menu
Menu keymap for background colors.Vfacemenu-special-menu
Menu keymap for non-face text-properties.Vfacemenu-justification-menu
Submenu for text justification commands.Vfacemenu-indentation-menu
Submenu for indentation commands.Vfacemenu-menu
Facemenu top-level menu keymap.Vfacemenu-keymap
Keymap for face-changing commands.
`Facemenu-update' fills in the keymap according to the bindings
requested in `facemenu-keybindings'.Vfacemenu-add-face-function
Function called at beginning of text to change or nil.
This function is passed the FACE to set and END of text to change, and must
return a string which is inserted.  It may set `facemenu-end-add-face'.Vfacemenu-end-add-face
String to insert or function called at end of text to change or nil.
This function is passed the FACE to set, and must return a string which is
inserted.Vfacemenu-remove-face-function
When non-nil, this is a function called to remove faces.
This function is passed the START and END of text to change.
May also be t meaning to use `facemenu-add-face-function'.Vfacemenu-color-alist
Alist of colors, used for completion.
If null, `facemenu-read-color' will set it.Ffacemenu-update
Add or update the "Face" menu in the menu bar.
You can call this to update things if you change any of the menu configuration
variables.Ffacemenu-set-face
Add FACE to the region or next character typed.
It will be added to the top of the face list; any faces lower on the list that
will not show through at all will be removed.

Interactively, the face to be used is read with the minibuffer.

In the Transient Mark mode, if the region is active and there is no
prefix argument, this command sets the region to the requested face.

Otherwise, this command specifies the face for the next character
inserted.  Moving point or switching buffers before
typing a character to insert cancels the specification.Ffacemenu-set-foreground
Set the foreground COLOR of the region or next character typed.
The color is prompted for.  A face named `fg:color' is used (or created).
If the region is active, it will be set to the requested face.  If
it is inactive (even if mark-even-if-inactive is set) the next
character that is typed (via `self-insert-command') will be set to
the selected face.  Moving point or switching buffers before
typing a character cancels the request.Ffacemenu-set-background
Set the background COLOR of the region or next character typed.
The color is prompted for.  A face named `bg:color' is used (or created).
If the region is active, it will be set to the requested face.  If
it is inactive (even if mark-even-if-inactive is set) the next
character that is typed (via `self-insert-command') will be set to
the selected face.  Moving point or switching buffers before
typing a character cancels the request.Ffacemenu-set-face-from-menu
Set the FACE of the region or next character typed.
This function is designed to be called from a menu; the face to use
is the menu item's name.

In the Transient Mark mode, if the region is active and there is no
prefix argument, this command sets the region to the requested face.

Otherwise, this command specifies the face for the next character
inserted.  Moving point or switching buffers before
typing a character to insert cancels the specification.Ffacemenu-set-invisible
Make the region invisible.
This sets the `invisible' text property; it can be undone with
`facemenu-remove-special'.Ffacemenu-set-intangible
Make the region intangible: disallow moving into it.
This sets the `intangible' text property; it can be undone with
`facemenu-remove-special'.Ffacemenu-set-read-only
Make the region unmodifiable.
This sets the `read-only' text property; it can be undone with
`facemenu-remove-special'.Ffacemenu-remove-face-props
Remove `face' and `mouse-face' text properties.Ffacemenu-remove-all
Remove all text properties from the region.Ffacemenu-remove-special
Remove all the "special" text properties from the region.
These special properties include `invisible', `intangible' and `read-only'.Flist-text-properties-at
Pop up a buffer listing text-properties at LOCATION.Ffacemenu-read-color
Read a color using the minibuffer.Flist-colors-display
Display names of defined colors, and show what they look like.
If the optional argument LIST is non-nil, it should be a list of
colors to display.  Otherwise, this command computes a list
of colors that the current display can handle.Ffacemenu-color-equal
Return t if colors A and B are the same color.
A and B should be strings naming colors.
This function queries the display system to find out what the color
names mean.  It returns nil if the colors differ or if it can't
determine the correct answer.Ffacemenu-add-face
Add FACE to text between START and END.
If START is nil or START to END is empty, add FACE to next typed character
instead.  For each section of that region that has a different face property,
FACE will be consed onto it, and other faces that are completely hidden by
that will be removed from the list.
If `facemenu-add-face-function' and maybe `facemenu-end-add-face' are non-`nil'
they are used to set the face information.

As a special case, if FACE is `default', then the region is left with NO face
text property.  Otherwise, selecting the default face would not have any
effect.  See `facemenu-remove-face-function'.Ffacemenu-active-faces
Return from FACE-LIST those faces that would be used for display.
This means each face attribute is not specified in a face earlier in FACE-LIST
and such a face is therefore active when used to display text.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, use the faces in that frame; otherwise
use the selected frame.  If t, then the global, non-frame faces are used.Ffacemenu-get-face
Make sure FACE exists.
If not, create it and add it to the appropriate menu.  Return the SYMBOL.

If a window system is in use, and this function creates a face named
`fg:color', then it sets the foreground to that color.  Likewise, `bg:color'
means to set the background.  In either case, if the color is undefined,
no color is set and a warning is issued.Ffacemenu-add-new-face
Add a FACE to the appropriate Face menu.
Automatically called when a new face is created.Ffacemenu-complete-face-list
Return list of all faces that look different.
Starts with given ALIST of faces, and adds elements only if they display 
differently from any face already on the list.
The faces on ALIST will end up at the end of the returned list, in reverse 
order.Ffacemenu-iterate
Apply FUNC to each element of LIST until one returns non-nil.
Returns the non-nil value it found, or nil if all were nil.Vface-font-selection-order
*A list specifying how face font selection chooses fonts.
Each of the four symbols `:width', `:height', `:weight', and `:slant'
must appear once in the list, and the list must not contain any other
elements.  Font selection tries to find a best matching font for
those face attributes first that appear first in the list.  For
example, if `:slant' appears before `:height', font selection first
tries to find a font with a suitable slant, even if this results in
a font height that isn't optimal.Vface-font-family-alternatives
*Alist of alternative font family names.
Each element has the the form (FAMILY ALTERNATIVE1 ALTERNATIVE2 ...).
If fonts of family FAMILY can't be loaded, try ALTERNATIVE1, then
ALTERNATIVE2 etc.Vface-font-registry-alternatives
*Alist of alternative font registry names.
Each element has the the form (REGISTRY ALTERNATIVE1 ALTERNATIVE2 ...).
If fonts of registry REGISTRY can be loaded, font selection
tries to find a best matching font among all fonts of registry
REGISTRY, ALTERNATIVE1, ALTERNATIVE2, and etc.Fface-list
Return a list of all defined face names.Fmake-face
Define a new face with name FACE, a symbol.
NO-INIT-FROM-RESOURCES non-nil means don't initialize frame-local
variants of FACE from X resources.  (X resources recognized are found
in the global variable `face-x-resources'.)  If FACE is already known
as a face, leave it unmodified.  Value is FACE.Fmake-empty-face
Define a new, empty face with name FACE.
If the face already exists, it is left unmodified.  Value is FACE.Fcopy-face
Define a face just like OLD-FACE, with name NEW-FACE.

If NEW-FACE already exists as a face, it is modified to be like
OLD-FACE.  If it doesn't already exist, it is created.

If the optional argument FRAME is given as a frame,  NEW-FACE is
changed on FRAME only.
If FRAME is t, the frame-independent default specification for OLD-FACE
is copied to NEW-FACE.
If FRAME is nil, copying is done for the frame-independent defaults
and for each existing frame.

If the optional fourth argument NEW-FRAME is given,
copy the information from face OLD-FACE on frame FRAME
to NEW-FACE on frame NEW-FRAME.Finternal-find-face
Retrieve the face named NAME.
Return nil if there is no such face.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, this gets the face NAME for
that frame; otherwise, it uses the selected frame.
If FRAME is the symbol t, then the global, non-frame face is returned.
If NAME is already a face, it is simply returned.

This function is defined for compatibility with Emacs 20.2.  It
should not be used anymore.Finternal-get-face
Retrieve the face named NAME; error if there is none.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, this gets the face NAME for
that frame; otherwise, it uses the selected frame.
If FRAME is the symbol t, then the global, non-frame face is returned.
If NAME is already a face, it is simply returned.

This function is defined for compatibility with Emacs 20.2.  It
should not be used anymore.Ffacep
Return non-nil if FACE is a face name.Fcheck-face
Signal an error if FACE doesn't name a face.
Value is FACE.Fface-id
Return the interNal ID of face with name FACE.
If optional argument FRAME is nil or omitted, use the selected frame.Fface-equal
Non-nil if faces FACE1 and FACE2 are equal.
Faces are considered equal if all their attributes are equal.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.Fface-differs-from-default-p
Non-nil if FACE displays differently from the default face.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.
A face is considered to be ``the same'' as the default face if it is
actually specified in the same way (equal attributes) or if it is
fully-unspecified, and thus inherits the attributes of any face it
is displayed on top of.Fface-nontrivial-p
True if face FACE has some non-nil attribute.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.Vface-x-resources
*List of X resources and classes for face attributes.
Each element has the form (ATTRIBUTE ENTRY1 ENTRY2...) where ATTRIBUTE is
the name of a face attribute, and each ENTRY is a cons of the form
(RESOURCE . CLASS) with RESOURCE being the resource and CLASS being the
X resource class for the attribute.Fset-face-attribute-from-resource
Set FACE's ATTRIBUTE from X resource RESOURCE, class CLASS on FRAME.
Value is the attribute value specified by the resource, or nil
if not present.  This function displays a message if the resource
specifies an invalid attribute.Fset-face-attributes-from-resources
Set attributes of FACE from X resources for FRAME.Fmake-face-x-resource-internal
Fill frame-local FACE on FRAME from X resources.
FRAME nil or not specified means do it for all frames.Fface-name

Return the value of FACE's ATTRIBUTE on FRAME.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.Fface-foreground
Return the foreground color name of FACE, or nil if unspecified.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.Fface-background
Return the background color name of FACE, or nil if unspecified.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.Fface-stipple
Return the stipple pixmap name of FACE, or nil if unspecified.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.Fface-underline-p
Return non-nil if FACE is underlined.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.Fface-inverse-video-p
Return non-nil if FACE is in inverse video on FRAME.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.Fface-bold-p
Return non-nil if the font of FACE is bold on FRAME.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.
Use `face-attribute' for finer control.Fface-italic-p
Return non-nil if the font of FACE is italic on FRAME.
If the optional argument FRAME is given, report on face FACE in that frame.
If FRAME is t, report on the defaults for face FACE (for new frames).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.
Use `face-attribute' for finer control.Fface-documentation
Get the documentation string for FACE.Fset-face-documentation
Set the documentation string for FACE to STRING.Fset-face-attribute
Set attributes of FACE on FRAME from ARGS.

FRAME nil means change attributes on all frames.  FRAME t means change
the default for new frames (this is done automatically each time an
attribute is changed on all frames).

ARGS must come in pairs ATTRIBUTE VALUE.  ATTRIBUTE must be a valid
face attribute name.  All attributes can be set to `unspecified';
this fact is not further mentioned below.

The following attributes are recognized:

`:family'

VALUE must be a string specifying the font family, e.g. ``courier'',
or a fontset alias name.  If a font family is specified, wild-cards `*'
and `?' are allowed.

`:width'

VALUE specifies the relative proportionate width of the font to use.
It must be one of the symbols `ultra-condensed', `extra-condensed',
`condensed', `semi-condensed', `normal', `semi-expanded', `expanded',
`extra-expanded', or `ultra-expanded'.

`:height'

VALUE must be either an integer specifying the height of the font to use
in 1/10 pt, a floating point number specifying the amount by which to
scale any underlying face, or a function, which is called with the old
height (from the underlying face), and should return the new height.

`:weight'

VALUE specifies the weight of the font to use.  It must be one of the
symbols `ultra-bold', `extra-bold', `bold', `semi-bold', `normal',
`semi-light', `light', `extra-light', `ultra-light'.

`:slant'

VALUE specifies the slant of the font to use.  It must be one of the
symbols `italic', `oblique', `normal', `reverse-italic', or
`reverse-oblique'.

`:foreground', `:background'

VALUE must be a color name, a string.

`:underline'

VALUE specifies whether characters in FACE should be underlined.  If
VALUE is t, underline with foreground color of the face.  If VALUE is
a string, underline with that color.  If VALUE is nil, explicitly
don't underline.

`:overline'

VALUE specifies whether characters in FACE should be overlined.  If
VALUE is t, overline with foreground color of the face.  If VALUE is a
string, overline with that color.  If VALUE is nil, explicitly don't
overline.

`:strike-through'

VALUE specifies whether characters in FACE should be drawn with a line
striking through them.  If VALUE is t, use the foreground color of the
face.  If VALUE is a string, strike-through with that color.  If VALUE
is nil, explicitly don't strike through.

`:box'

VALUE specifies whether characters in FACE should have a box drawn
around them.  If VALUE is nil, explicitly don't draw boxes.  If
VALUE is t, draw a box with lines of width 1 in the foreground color
of the face.  If VALUE is a string, the string must be a color name,
and the box is drawn in that color with a line width of 1.  Otherwise,
VALUE must be a property list of the form `(:line-width WIDTH
:color COLOR :style STYLE)'.  If a keyword/value pair is missing from
the property list, a default value will be used for the value, as
specified below.  WIDTH specifies the width of the lines to draw; it
defaults to 1.  If WIDTH is negative, the absolute value is the width
of the lines, and draw top/bottom lines inside the characters area,
not around it.  COLOR is the name of the color to draw in, default is
the foreground color of the face for simple boxes, and the background
color of the face for 3D boxes.  STYLE specifies whether a 3D box
should be draw.  If STYLE is `released-button', draw a box looking
like a released 3D button.  If STYLE is `pressed-button' draw a box
that appears like a pressed button.  If STYLE is nil, the default if
the property list doesn't contain a style specification, draw a 2D
box.

`:inverse-video'

VALUE specifies whether characters in FACE should be displayed in
inverse video.  VALUE must be one of t or nil.

`:stipple'

If VALUE is a string, it must be the name of a file of pixmap data.
The directories listed in the `x-bitmap-file-path' variable are
searched.  Alternatively, VALUE may be a list of the form (WIDTH
HEIGHT DATA) where WIDTH and HEIGHT are the size in pixels, and DATA
is a string containing the raw bits of the bitmap.  VALUE nil means
explicitly don't use a stipple pattern.

For convenience, attributes `:family', `:width', `:height', `:weight',
and `:slant' may also be set in one step from an X font name:

`:font'

Set font-related face attributes from VALUE.  VALUE must be a valid
XLFD font name.  If it is a font name pattern, the first matching font
will be used.

For compatibility with Emacs 20, keywords `:bold' and `:italic' can
be used to specify that a bold or italic font should be used.  VALUE
must be t or nil in that case.  A value of `unspecified' is not allowed.

`:inherit'

VALUE is the name of a face from which to inherit attributes, or a list
of face names.  Attributes from inherited faces are merged into the face
like an underlying face would be, with higher priority than underlying faces.Fmake-face-bold

where WIDTH and HEIGHT are the size in pixels,
and DATA is a string, containing the raw bits of the bitmap.Fset-face-underline
Specify whether face FACE is underlined.

*Text string to display as the sample text for `list-faces-display'.Flist-faces-display
List all faces, using the same sample text in each.
The sample text is a string that comes from the variable
`list-faces-sample-text'.Fdescribe-face

The argument FRAME specifies which frame to try.
The value may be different for frames on different display types.
If FRAME doesn't support colors, the value is nil.Fcolor-defined-p

If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.
If FRAME cannot display COLOR, the value is nil.
If COLOR is the symbol `unspecified' or one of the strings
"unspecified-fg" or "unspecified-bg", the value is nil.Fdisplay-color-p
Return t if DISPLAY supports color.
The optional argument DISPLAY specifies which display to ask about.
DISPLAY should be either a frame or a display name (a string).
If omitted or nil, that stands for the selected frame's display.Fdisplay-grayscale-p
Return non-nil if frames on DISPLAY can display shades of gray.Vframe-background-mode
*The brightness of the background.
Set this to the symbol `dark' if your background color is dark, `light' if
your background is light, or nil (default) if you want Emacs to
examine the brightness for you.  Don't set this variable with `setq';
this won't have the expected effect.Fframe-set-background-mode
Set up display-dependent faces on FRAME.
Display-dependent faces are those which have different definitions
according to the `background-mode' and `display-type' frame parameters.Fx-handle-named-frame-geometry
Add geometry parameters for a named frame to parameter list PARAMETERS.
Value is the new parameter list.Fx-handle-reverse-video
Handle the reverse-video frame parameter and X resource.
`x-create-frame' does not handle this one.Fx-create-frame-with-faces
Create a frame from optional frame parameters PARAMETERS.
Parameters not specified by PARAMETERS are taken from
`default-frame-alist'.  If PARAMETERS specify a frame name,
handle X geometry resources for that name.  If either PARAMETERS
or `default-frame-alist' contains a `reverse' parameter, or
the X resource ``reverseVideo'' is present, handle that.
Value is the new frame created.Fface-set-after-frame-default
Set frame-local faces of FRAME from face specs and resources.
Initialize colors of certain faces from frame parameters.Ftty-handle-reverse-video
Handle the reverse-video frame parameter for terminal frames.Ftty-create-frame-with-faces

`default-frame-alist'.  If either PARAMETERS or `default-frame-alist'
contains a `reverse' parameter, handle that.  Value is the new frame
created.Fx-resolve-font-name
Return a font name matching PATTERN.
All wildcards in PATTERN are instantiated.
If PATTERN is nil, return the name of the frame's base font, which never
contains wildcards.
Given optional arguments FACE and FRAME, return a font which is
also the same size as FACE on FRAME, or fail.Fx-make-font-bold
Given an X font specification, make a bold version of it.
If that can't be done, return nil.Fx-make-font-demibold
Given an X font specification, make a demibold version of it.

If that can't be done, return nil.Fx-make-font-bold-italic
Given an X font specification, make a bold and italic version of it.
If that can't be done, return nil.Vdelete-auto-save-files
*Non-nil means delete auto-save file when a buffer is saved or killed.

Note that auto-save file will not be deleted if the buffer is killed
when it has unsaved changes.Vdirectory-abbrev-alist
*Alist of abbreviations for file directories.
A list of elements of the form (FROM . TO), each meaning to replace
FROM with TO when it appears in a directory name.  This replacement is
done when setting up the default directory of a newly visited file.
*Every* FROM string should start with `^'.

Do not use `~' in the TO strings.
They should be ordinary absolute directory names.

Use this feature when you have directories which you normally refer to
via absolute symbolic links.  Make TO the name of the link, and FROM
the name it is linked to.Vmake-backup-files
*Non-nil means make a backup of a file the first time it is saved.
This can be done by renaming the file or by copying.

Renaming means that Emacs renames the existing file so that it is a
backup file, then writes the buffer into a new file.  Any other names
that the old file had will now refer to the backup file.  The new file
is owned by you and its group is defaulted.

Copying means that Emacs copies the existing file into the backup
file, then writes the buffer on top of the existing file.  Any other
names that the old file had will now refer to the new (edited) file.
The file's owner and group are unchanged.

The choice of renaming or copying is controlled by the variables
`backup-by-copying', `backup-by-copying-when-linked',
`backup-by-copying-when-mismatch' and
`backup-by-copying-when-privileged-mismatch'.  See also `backup-inhibited'.Vbackup-inhibited
Non-nil means don't make a backup, regardless of the other parameters.
This variable is intended for use by making it local to a buffer.
But it is local only if you make it local.Vbackup-by-copying
*Non-nil means always use copying to create backup files.
See documentation of variable `make-backup-files'.Vbackup-by-copying-when-linked
*Non-nil means use copying to create backups for files with multiple names.
This causes the alternate names to refer to the latest version as edited.
This variable is relevant only if `backup-by-copying' is nil.Vbackup-by-copying-when-mismatch
*Non-nil means create backups by copying if this preserves owner or group.
Renaming may still be used (subject to control of other variables)
when it would not result in changing the owner or group of the file;
that is, for files which are owned by you and whose group matches
the default for a new file created there by you.
This variable is relevant only if `backup-by-copying' is nil.Vbackup-by-copying-when-privileged-mismatch
*Non-nil means create backups by copying to preserve a privileged owner.
Renaming may still be used (subject to control of other variables)
when it would not result in changing the owner of the file or if the owner
has a user id greater than the value of this variable.  This is useful
when low-numbered uid's are used for special system users (such as root)
that must maintain ownership of certain files.
This variable is relevant only if `backup-by-copying' and
`backup-by-copying-when-mismatch' are nil.Fnormal-backup-enable-predicate
Default `backup-enable-predicate' function.
Checks for files in `temporary-file-directory' or
`small-temporary-file-directory'.Vbackup-enable-predicate
Predicate that looks at a file name and decides whether to make backups.
Called with an absolute file name as argument, it returns t to enable backup.Vbuffer-offer-save
*Non-nil in a buffer means always offer to save buffer on exit.
Do so even if the buffer is not visiting a file.
Automatically local in all buffers.Vfind-file-existing-other-name
*Non-nil means find a file under alternative names, in existing buffers.
This means if any existing buffer is visiting the file you want
under another name, you get the existing buffer instead of a new buffer.Vfind-file-visit-truename
*Non-nil means visit a file under its truename.
The truename of a file is found by chasing all links
both at the file level and at the levels of the containing directories.Vrevert-without-query
*Specify which files should be reverted without query.
The value is a list of regular expressions.
If the file name matches one of these regular expressions,
then `revert-buffer' reverts the file without querying
if the file has changed on disk and you have not edited the buffer.Vbuffer-file-number
The device number and file number of the file visited in the current buffer.
The value is a list of the form (FILENUM DEVNUM).
This pair of numbers uniquely identifies the file.
If the buffer is visiting a new file, the value is nil.Vbuffer-file-numbers-unique
Non-nil means that buffer-file-number uniquely identifies files.Vtemporary-file-directory
The directory for writing temporary files.Vsmall-temporary-file-directory
The directory for writing small temporary files.
If non-nil, this directory is used instead of `temporary-file-directory'
by programs that create small temporary files.  This is for systems that
have fast storage with limited space, such as a RAM disk.Vnull-device
The system null device.Vfile-name-invalid-regexp
Regexp recognizing file names which aren't allowed by the filesystem.Vfile-precious-flag
*Non-nil means protect against I/O errors while saving files.
Some modes set this non-nil in particular buffers.

This feature works by writing the new contents into a temporary file
and then renaming the temporary file to replace the original.
In this way, any I/O error in writing leaves the original untouched,
and there is never any instant where the file is nonexistent.

Note that this feature forces backups to be made by copying.
Yet, at the same time, saving a precious file
breaks any hard links between it and other files.Vversion-control
*Control use of version numbers for backup files.
t means make numeric backup versions unconditionally.
nil means make them for files that have some already.
`never' means do not make them.Vdired-kept-versions
*When cleaning directory, number of versions to keep.Vdelete-old-versions
*If t, delete excess backup versions silently.
If nil, ask confirmation.  Any other value prevents any trimming.Vkept-old-versions
*Number of oldest versions to keep when a new numbered backup is made.Vkept-new-versions
*Number of newest versions to keep when a new numbered backup is made.
Includes the new backup.  Must be > 0Vrequire-final-newline
*Value of t says silently ensure a file ends in a newline when it is saved.
Non-nil but not t says ask user whether to add a newline when there isn't one.
nil means don't add newlines.Vauto-save-default
*Non-nil says by default do auto-saving of every file-visiting buffer.Vauto-save-visited-file-name
*Non-nil says auto-save a buffer in the file it is visiting, when practical.
Normally auto-save files are written under other names.Vauto-save-file-name-transforms
*Transforms to apply to buffer file name before making auto-save file name.
Each transform is a list (REGEXP REPLACEMENT):
REGEXP is a regular expression to match against the file name.
If it matches, `replace-match' is used to replace the
matching part with REPLACEMENT.
All the transforms in the list are tried, in the order they are listed.
When one transform applies, its result is final;
no further transforms are tried.

The default value is set up to put the auto-save file into the
temporary directory (see the variable `temporary-file-directory') for
editing a remote file.Vsave-abbrevs
*Non-nil means save word abbrevs too when files are saved.
If `silently', don't ask the user before saving.
Loading an abbrev file sets this to t.Vfind-file-run-dired
*Non-nil means allow `find-file' to visit directories.
To visit the directory, `find-file' runs `find-directory-functions'.Vfind-directory-functions
*List of functions to try in sequence to visit a directory.
Each function is called with the directory name as the sole argument
and should return either a buffer or nil.Vfind-file-not-found-hooks
List of functions to be called for `find-file' on nonexistent file.
These functions are called as soon as the error is detected.
Variable `buffer-file-name' is already set up.
The functions are called in the order given until one of them returns non-nil.Vfind-file-hooks
List of functions to be called after a buffer is loaded from a file.
The buffer's local variables (if any) will have been processed before the
functions are called.Vwrite-file-hooks
List of functions to be called before writing out a buffer to a file.
If one of them returns non-nil, the file is considered already written
and the rest are not called.
These hooks are considered to pertain to the visited file.
So any buffer-local binding of `write-file-hooks' is
discarded if you change the visited file name with \[set-visited-file-name].

Don't make this variable buffer-local; instead, use `local-write-file-hooks'.
See also `write-contents-hooks'.Vlocal-write-file-hooks
Just like `write-file-hooks', except intended for per-buffer use.
The functions in this list are called before the ones in
`write-file-hooks'.

This variable is meant to be used for hooks that have to do with a
particular visited file.  Therefore, it is a permanent local, so that
changing the major mode does not clear it.  However, calling
`set-visited-file-name' does clear it.Vwrite-contents-hooks
List of functions to be called before writing out a buffer to a file.
If one of them returns non-nil, the file is considered already written
and the rest are not called.

This variable is meant to be used for hooks that pertain to the
buffer's contents, not to the particular visited file; thus,
`set-visited-file-name' does not clear this variable; but changing the
major mode does clear it.

This variable automatically becomes buffer-local whenever it is set.
If you use `add-hook' to add elements to the list, use nil for the
LOCAL argument.

See also `write-file-hooks'.Venable-local-variables
*Control use of local variables in files you visit.
The value can be t, nil or something else.
A value of t means file local variables specifications are obeyed;
nil means they are ignored; anything else means query.
This variable also controls use of major modes specified in
a -*- line.

The command \[normal-mode], when used interactively,
always obeys file local variable specifications and the -*- line,
and ignores this variable.Vlocal-enable-local-variables
Like `enable-local-variables' but meant for buffer-local bindings.
The meaningful values are nil and non-nil.  The default is non-nil.
If a major mode sets this to nil, buffer-locally, then any local
variables list in the file will be ignored.

This variable does not affect the use of major modes
specified in a -*- line.Venable-local-eval
*Control processing of the "variable" `eval' in a file's local variables.
The value can be t, nil or something else.
A value of t means obey `eval' variables;
nil means ignore them; anything else means query.

The command \[normal-mode] always obeys local-variables lists
and ignores this variable.Vview-read-only
*Non-nil means buffers visiting files read-only, do it in view mode.Fange-ftp-completion-hook-function
Provides support for ange-ftp host name completion.
Runs the usual ange-ftp hook, but only for completion operations.Fconvert-standard-filename
Convert a standard file's name to something suitable for the current OS.
This function's standard definition is trivial; it just returns the argument.
However, on some systems, the function is redefined with a definition
that really does change some file names to canonicalize certain
patterns and to guarantee valid names.Fpwd
Show the current default directory.Vcd-path
Value of the CDPATH environment variable, as a list.
Not actually set up until the first time you use it.Fparse-colon-path
Explode a colon-separated search path into a list of directory names.
(For values of `colon' equal to `path-separator'.)Fcd-absolute
Change current directory to given absolute file name DIR.Fcd
Make DIR become the current buffer's default directory.
If your environment includes a `CDPATH' variable, try each one of that
colon-separated list of directories when resolving a relative directory name.Fload-file
Load the Lisp file named FILE.Fload-library
Load the library named LIBRARY.
This is an interface to the function `load'.Ffile-local-copy
Copy the file FILE into a temporary file on this machine.
Returns the name of the local copy, or nil, if FILE is directly
accessible.Ffile-truename
Return the truename of FILENAME, which should be absolute.
The truename of a file name is found by chasing symbolic links
both at the level of the file and at the level of the directories
containing it, until no links are left at any level.

The arguments COUNTER and PREV-DIRS are used only in recursive calls.
Do not specify them in other calls.Ffile-chase-links
Chase links in FILENAME until a name that is not a link.
Does not examine containing directories for links,
unlike `file-truename'.Fswitch-to-buffer-other-window
Select buffer BUFFER in another window.
Optional second arg NORECORD non-nil means
do not put this buffer at the front of the list of recently selected ones.

This uses the function `display-buffer' as a subroutine; see its
documentation for additional customization information.Fswitch-to-buffer-other-frame
Switch to buffer BUFFER in another frame.
Optional second arg NORECORD non-nil means
do not put this buffer at the front of the list of recently selected ones.

This uses the function `display-buffer' as a subroutine; see its
documentation for additional customization information.Ffind-file
Edit file FILENAME.
Switch to a buffer visiting file FILENAME,
creating one if none already exists.
Interactively, or if WILDCARDS is non-nil in a call from Lisp,
expand wildcards (if any) and visit multiple files.  Wildcard expansion
can be suppressed by setting `find-file-wildcards'.Ffind-file-other-window
Edit file FILENAME, in another window.
May create a new window, or reuse an existing one.
See the function `display-buffer'.
Interactively, or if WILDCARDS is non-nil in a call from Lisp,
expand wildcards (if any) and visit multiple files.Ffind-file-other-frame
Edit file FILENAME, in another frame.
May create a new frame, or reuse an existing one.
See the function `display-buffer'.
Interactively, or if WILDCARDS is non-nil in a call from Lisp,
expand wildcards (if any) and visit multiple files.Ffind-file-read-only
Edit file FILENAME but don't allow changes.
Like `find-file' but marks buffer as read-only.
Use \[toggle-read-only] to permit editing.Ffind-file-read-only-other-window
Edit file FILENAME in another window but don't allow changes.
Like \[find-file-other-window] but marks buffer as read-only.
Use \[toggle-read-only] to permit editing.Ffind-file-read-only-other-frame
Edit file FILENAME in another frame but don't allow changes.
Like \[find-file-other-frame] but marks buffer as read-only.
Use \[toggle-read-only] to permit editing.Ffind-alternate-file-other-window
Find file FILENAME as a replacement for the file in the next window.
This command does not select that window.Ffind-alternate-file
Find file FILENAME, select its buffer, kill previous buffer.
If the current buffer now contains an empty file that you just visited
(presumably by mistake), use this command to visit the file you really want.Fcreate-file-buffer
Create a suitably named buffer for visiting FILENAME, and return it.
FILENAME (sans directory) is used unchanged if that name is free;
otherwise a string <2> or <3> or ... is appended to get an unused name.Fgenerate-new-buffer
Create and return a buffer with a name based on NAME.
Choose the buffer's name using `generate-new-buffer-name'.Vautomount-dir-prefix
Regexp to match the automounter prefix in a directory name.Vabbreviated-home-dir
The user's homedir abbreviated according to `directory-abbrev-alist'.Fabbreviate-file-name
Return a version of FILENAME shortened using `directory-abbrev-alist'.
This also substitutes "~" for the user's home directory.
Type \[describe-variable] directory-abbrev-alist RET for more information.Vfind-file-not-true-dirname-list
*List of logical names for which visiting shouldn't save the true dirname.
On VMS, when you visit a file using a logical name that searches a path,
you may or may not want the visited file name to record the specific
directory where the file was found.  If you *do not* want that, add the logical
name to this list as a string.Ffind-buffer-visiting
Return the buffer visiting file FILENAME (a string).
This is like `get-file-buffer', except that it checks for any buffer
visiting the same file, possibly under a different name.
If there is no such live buffer, return nil.Vfind-file-wildcards
*Non-nil means file-visiting commands should handle wildcards.
For example, if you specify `*.c', that would visit all the files
whose names match the pattern.Vfind-file-suppress-same-file-warnings
*Non-nil means suppress warning messages for symlinked files.
When nil, Emacs prints a warning when visiting a file that is already
visited, but with a different name.  Setting this option to t
suppresses this warning.Ffind-file-noselect
Read file FILENAME into a buffer and return the buffer.
If a buffer exists visiting FILENAME, return that one, but
verify that the file has not changed since visited or saved.
The buffer is not selected, just returned to the caller.
Optional first arg NOWARN non-nil means suppress any warning messages.
Optional second arg RAWFILE non-nil means the file is read literally.
Optional third arg WILDCARDS non-nil means do wildcard processing
and visit all the matching files.  When wildcards are actually
used and expanded, the value is a list of buffers
that are visiting the various files.Finsert-file-contents-literally
Like `insert-file-contents', but only reads in the file literally.
A buffer may be modified in several ways after reading into the buffer,
to Emacs features such as format decoding, character code
conversion, `find-file-hooks', automatic uncompression, etc.

This function ensures that none of these modifications will take place.Finsert-file-literally
Insert contents of file FILENAME into buffer after point with no conversion.

This function is meant for the user to run interactively.
Don't call it from programs!  Use `insert-file-contents-literally' instead.
(Its calling sequence is different; see its documentation).Vfind-file-literally
Non-nil if this buffer was made by `find-file-literally' or equivalent.
This is a permanent local.Ffind-file-literally
Visit file FILENAME with no conversion of any kind.
Format conversion and character code conversion are both disabled,
and multibyte characters are disabled in the resulting buffer.
The major mode used is Fundamental mode regardless of the file name,
and local variable specifications in the file are ignored.
Automatic uncompression and adding a newline at the end of the
file due to `require-final-newline' is also disabled.

You cannot absolutely rely on this function to result in
visiting the file literally.  If Emacs already has a buffer
which is visiting the file, you get the existing buffer,
regardless of whether it was created literally or not.

In a Lisp program, if you want to be sure of accessing a file's
contents literally, you should create a temporary buffer and then read
the file contents into it using `insert-file-contents-literally'.Fafter-find-file
Called after finding a file and by the default revert function.
Sets buffer mode, parses local variables.
Optional args ERROR, WARN, and NOAUTO: ERROR non-nil means there was an
error in reading the file.  WARN non-nil means warn if there
exists an auto-save file more recent than the visited file.
NOAUTO means don't mess with auto-save mode.
Fourth arg AFTER-FIND-FILE-FROM-REVERT-BUFFER non-nil
 means this call was from `revert-buffer'.
Fifth arg NOMODES non-nil means don't alter the file's modes.
Finishes by calling the functions in `find-file-hooks'
unless NOMODES is non-nil.Fnormal-mode
Choose the major mode for this buffer automatically.
Also sets up any specified local variables of the file.
Uses the visited file name, the -*- line, and the local variables spec.

This function is called automatically from `find-file'.  In that case,
we may set up the file-specified mode and local variables,
depending on the value of `enable-local-variables': if it is t, we do;
if it is nil, we don't; otherwise, we query.
In addition, if `local-enable-local-variables' is nil, we do
not set local variables (though we do notice a mode specified with -*-.)

`enable-local-variables' is ignored if you run `normal-mode' interactively,
or from Lisp without specifying the optional argument FIND-FILE;
in that case, this function acts as if `enable-local-variables' were t.Vauto-mode-alist
Alist of filename patterns vs corresponding major mode functions.
Each element looks like (REGEXP . FUNCTION) or (REGEXP FUNCTION NON-NIL).
(NON-NIL stands for anything that is not nil; the value does not matter.)
Visiting a file whose name matches REGEXP specifies FUNCTION as the
mode function to use.  FUNCTION will be called, unless it is nil.

If the element has the form (REGEXP FUNCTION NON-NIL), then after
calling FUNCTION (if it's not nil), we delete the suffix that matched
REGEXP and search the list again for another match.Vinterpreter-mode-alist
Alist mapping interpreter names to major modes.
This alist applies to files whose first line starts with `#!'.
Each element looks like (INTERPRETER . MODE).
The car of each element is compared with
the name of the interpreter specified in the first line.
If it matches, mode MODE is selected.Vinhibit-first-line-modes-regexps
List of regexps; if one matches a file name, don't look for `-*-'.Vinhibit-first-line-modes-suffixes
List of regexps for what to ignore, for `inhibit-first-line-modes-regexps'.
When checking `inhibit-first-line-modes-regexps', we first discard
from the end of the file name anything that matches one of these regexps.Vauto-mode-interpreter-regexp
Regular expression matching interpreters, for file mode determination.
This regular expression is matched against the first line of a file
to determine the file's mode in `set-auto-mode' when Emacs can't deduce
a mode from the file's name.  If it matches, the file is assumed to
be interpreted by the interpreter matched by the second group of the
regular expression.  The mode is then determined as the mode associated
with that interpreter in `interpreter-mode-alist'.Fset-auto-mode
Select major mode appropriate for current buffer.
This checks for a -*- mode tag in the buffer's text,
compares the filename against the entries in `auto-mode-alist',
or checks the interpreter that runs this file against
`interpreter-mode-alist'.

It does not check for the `mode:' local variable in the
Local Variables section of the file; for that, use `hack-local-variables'.

If `enable-local-variables' is nil, this function does not check for a
-*- mode tag.

If the optional argument JUST-FROM-FILE-NAME is non-nil,
then we do not set anything but the major mode,
and we don't even do that unless it would come from the file name.Fhack-local-variables-prop-line
Set local variables specified in the -*- line.
Ignore any specification for `mode:' and `coding:';
`set-auto-mode' should already have handled `mode:',
`set-auto-coding' should already have handled `coding:'.Vhack-local-variables-hook
Normal hook run after processing a file's local variables specs.
Major modes can use this to examine user-specified local variables
in order to initialize other data structure based on them.Fhack-local-variables
Parse and put into effect this buffer's local variables spec.
If MODE-ONLY is non-nil, all we do is check whether the major mode
is specified, returning t if it is specified.Vignored-local-variables
Variables to be ignored in a file's local variable spec.Fhack-one-local-variable
"Set" one variable in a local variables spec.
A few variable names are treated specially.Vchange-major-mode-with-file-name
*Non-nil means \[write-file] should set the major mode from the file name.
However, the mode will not be changed if
(1) a local variables list or the `-*-' line specifies a major mode, or
(2) the current major mode is a "special" mode,
   not suitable for ordinary files, or
(3) the new file name does not particularly specify any mode.Fset-visited-file-name
Change name of file visited in current buffer to FILENAME.
The next time the buffer is saved it will go in the newly specified file.
nil or empty string as argument means make buffer not be visiting any file.
Remember to delete the initial contents of the minibuffer
if you wish to pass an empty string as the argument.

The optional second argument NO-QUERY, if non-nil, inhibits asking for
confirmation in the case where another buffer is already visiting FILENAME.

The optional third argument ALONG-WITH-FILE, if non-nil, means that
the old visited file has been renamed to the new name FILENAME.Fwrite-file
Write current buffer into file FILENAME.
This makes the buffer visit that file, and marks it as not modified.

If you specify just a directory name as FILENAME, that means to use
the default file name but in that directory.  You can also yank
the default file name into the minibuffer to edit it, using M-n.

If the buffer is not already visiting a file, the default file name
for the output file is the buffer name.

If optional second arg CONFIRM is non-nil, this function
asks for confirmation before overwriting an existing file.
Interactively, confirmation is required unless you supply a prefix argument.Fbackup-buffer
Make a backup of the disk file visited by the current buffer, if appropriate.
This is normally done before saving the buffer the first time.
If the value is non-nil, it is the result of `file-modes' on the original
file; this means that the caller, after saving the buffer, should change
the modes of the new file to agree with the old modes.

A backup may be done by renaming or by copying; see documentation of
variable `make-backup-files'.  If it's done by renaming, then the file is
no longer accessible under its old name.Ffile-name-sans-versions
Return file NAME sans backup versions or strings.
This is a separate procedure so your site-init or startup file can
redefine it.
If the optional argument KEEP-BACKUP-VERSION is non-nil,
we do not remove backup version numbers, only true file version numbers.Ffile-ownership-preserved-p
Return t if deleting FILE and rewriting it would preserve the owner.Ffile-name-sans-extension
Return FILENAME sans final "extension".
The extension, in a file name, is the part that follows the last `.'.Ffile-name-extension
Return FILENAME's final "extension".
The extension, in a file name, is the part that follows the last `.'.
Return nil for extensionless file names such as `foo'.
Return the empty string for file names such as `foo.'.

If PERIOD is non-nil, then the returned value includes the period
that delimits the extension, and if FILENAME has no extension,
the value is "".Vmake-backup-file-name-function
A function to use instead of the default `make-backup-file-name'.
A value of nil gives the default `make-backup-file-name' behaviour.

This could be buffer-local to do something special for specific
files.  If you define it, you may need to change `backup-file-name-p'
and `file-name-sans-versions' too.

See also `backup-directory-alist'.Vbackup-directory-alist
Alist of filename patterns and backup directory names.
Each element looks like (REGEXP . DIRECTORY).  Backups of files with
names matching REGEXP will be made in DIRECTORY.  DIRECTORY may be
relative or absolute.  If it is absolute, so that all matching files
are backed up into the same directory, the file names in this
directory will be the full name of the file backed up with all
directory separators changed to `!' to prevent clashes.  This will not
work correctly if your filesystem truncates the resulting name.

For the common case of all backups going into one directory, the alist
should contain a single element pairing "." with the appropriate
directory name.

If this variable is nil, or it fails to match a filename, the backup
is made in the original file's directory.

On MS-DOS filesystems without long names this variable is always
ignored.Fmake-backup-file-name
Create the non-numeric backup file name for FILE.
Normally this will just be the file's name with `~' appended.
Customization hooks are provided as follows.

If the variable `make-backup-file-name-function' is non-nil, its value
should be a function which will be called with FILE as its argument;
the resulting name is used.

Otherwise a match for FILE is sought in `backup-directory-alist'; see
the documentation of that variable.  If the directory for the backup
doesn't exist, it is created.Fmake-backup-file-name-1
Subroutine of `make-backup-file-name' and `find-backup-file-name'.Fbackup-file-name-p
Return non-nil if FILE is a backup file name (numeric or not).
This is a separate function so you can redefine it for customization.
You may need to redefine `file-name-sans-versions' as well.Fbackup-extract-version
Given the name of a numeric backup file, FN, return the backup number.
Uses the free variable `backup-extract-version-start', whose value should be
the index in the name where the version number begins.Ffind-backup-file-name
Find a file name for a backup file FN, and suggestions for deletions.
Value is a list whose car is the name for the backup file
and whose cdr is a list of old versions to consider deleting now.
If the value is nil, don't make a backup.
Uses `backup-directory-alist' in the same way as does
`make-backup-file-name'.Ffile-nlinks
Return number of names file FILENAME has.Ffile-relative-name
Convert FILENAME to be relative to DIRECTORY (default: `default-directory').
This function returns a relative file name which is equivalent to FILENAME
when used with that default directory as the default.
If this is impossible (which can happen on MSDOS and Windows
when the file name and directory use different drive names)
then it returns FILENAME.Fsave-buffer
Save current buffer in visited file if modified.  Versions described below.
By default, makes the previous version into a backup file
 if previously requested or if this is the first save.
With 1 \[universal-argument], marks this version
 to become a backup when the next save is done.
With 2 \[universal-argument]'s,
 unconditionally makes the previous version into a backup file.
With 3 \[universal-argument]'s, marks this version
 to become a backup when the next save is done,
 and unconditionally makes the previous version into a backup file.

With argument of 0, never make the previous version into a backup file.

If a file's name is FOO, the names of its numbered backup versions are
 FOO.~i~ for various integers i.  A non-numbered backup file is called FOO~.
Numeric backups (rather than FOO~) will be made if value of
 `version-control' is not the atom `never' and either there are already
 numeric versions of the file being backed up, or `version-control' is
 non-nil.
We don't want excessive versions piling up, so there are variables
 `kept-old-versions', which tells Emacs how many oldest versions to keep,
 and `kept-new-versions', which tells how many newest versions to keep.
 Defaults are 2 old versions and 2 new.
`dired-kept-versions' controls dired's clean-directory (.) command.
If `delete-old-versions' is nil, system will query user
 before trimming versions.  Otherwise it does it silently.

If `vc-make-backup-files' is nil, which is the default,
 no backup files are made for files managed by version control.
 (This is because the version control system itself records previous versions.)

See the subroutine `basic-save-buffer' for more information.Fdelete-auto-save-file-if-necessary
Delete auto-save file for current buffer if `delete-auto-save-files' is t.
Normally delete only if the file was written by this Emacs since
the last real save, but optional arg FORCE non-nil means delete anyway.Vauto-save-hook
Normal hook run just before auto-saving.Vafter-save-hook
Normal hook that is run after a buffer is saved to its file.Vsave-buffer-coding-system
If non-nil, use this coding system for saving the buffer.
More precisely, use this coding system in place of the
value of `buffer-file-coding-system', when saving the buffer.
Calling `write-region' for any purpose other than saving the buffer
will still use `buffer-file-coding-system'; this variable has no effect
in such cases.Fbasic-save-buffer
Save the current buffer in its visited file, if it has been modified.
The hooks `write-contents-hooks', `local-write-file-hooks' and
`write-file-hooks' get a chance to do the job of saving; if they do not,
then the buffer is saved in the visited file file in the usual way.
After saving the buffer, this function runs `after-save-hook'.Fsave-some-buffers
Save some modified file-visiting buffers.  Asks user about each one.
Optional argument (the prefix) non-nil means save all with no questions.
Optional second argument PRED determines which buffers are considered:
If PRED is nil, all the file-visiting buffers are considered.
If PRED is t, then certain non-file buffers will also be considered.
If PRED is a zero-argument function, it indicates for each buffer whether
to consider it or not when called with that buffer current.Fnot-modified
Mark current buffer as unmodified, not needing to be saved.
With prefix arg, mark buffer as modified, so \[save-buffer] will save.

It is not a good idea to use this function in Lisp programs, because it
prints a message in the minibuffer.  Instead, use `set-buffer-modified-p'.Ftoggle-read-only
Change whether this buffer is visiting its file read-only.
With arg, set read-only iff arg is positive.
If visiting file read-only and `view-read-only' is non-nil, enter view mode.Finsert-file
Insert contents of file FILENAME into buffer after point.
Set mark after the inserted text.

This function is meant for the user to run interactively.
Don't call it from programs!  Use `insert-file-contents' instead.
(Its calling sequence is different; see its documentation).Fappend-to-file
Append the contents of the region to the end of file FILENAME.
When called from a function, expects three arguments,
START, END and FILENAME.  START and END are buffer positions
saying what text to write.Ffile-newest-backup
Return most recent backup file for FILENAME or nil if no backups exist.Frename-uniquely
Rename current buffer to a similar name not already taken.
This function is useful for creating multiple shell process buffers
or multiple mail buffers, etc.Fmake-directory
Create the directory DIR and any nonexistent parent dirs.
Interactively, the default choice of directory to create
is the current default directory for file names.
That is useful when you have visited a file in a nonexistent directory.

Noninteractively, the second (optional) argument PARENTS says whether
to create parent directories if they don't exist.Vrevert-buffer-function
Function to use to revert this buffer, or nil to do the default.
The function receives two arguments IGNORE-AUTO and NOCONFIRM,
which are the arguments that `revert-buffer' received.Vrevert-buffer-insert-file-contents-function
Function to use to insert contents when reverting this buffer.
Gets two args, first the nominal file name to use,
and second, t if reading the auto-save file.

The function you specify is responsible for updating (or preserving) point.Vbefore-revert-hook
Normal hook for `revert-buffer' to run before reverting.
If `revert-buffer-function' is used to override the normal revert
mechanism, this hook is not used.Vafter-revert-hook
Normal hook for `revert-buffer' to run after reverting.
Note that the hook value that it runs is the value that was in effect
before reverting; that makes a difference if you have buffer-local
hook functions.

If `revert-buffer-function' is used to override the normal revert
mechanism, this hook is not used.Frevert-buffer
Replace current buffer text with the text of the visited file on disk.
This undoes all changes since the file was visited or saved.
With a prefix argument, offer to revert from latest auto-save file, if
that is more recent than the visited file.

This command also works for special buffers that contain text which
doesn't come from a file, but reflects some other data base instead:
for example, Dired buffers and buffer-list buffers.  In these cases,
it reconstructs the buffer contents from the appropriate data base.

When called from Lisp, the first argument is IGNORE-AUTO; only offer
to revert from the auto-save file when this is nil.  Note that the
sense of this argument is the reverse of the prefix argument, for the
sake of backward compatibility.  IGNORE-AUTO is optional, defaulting
to nil.

Optional second argument NOCONFIRM means don't ask for confirmation at
all.  (The local variable `revert-without-query', if non-nil, prevents
confirmation.)

Optional third argument PRESERVE-MODES non-nil means don't alter
the files modes.  Normally we reinitialize them using `normal-mode'.

If the value of `revert-buffer-function' is non-nil, it is called to
do all the work for this command.  Otherwise, the hooks
`before-revert-hook' and `after-revert-hook' are run at the beginning
and the end, and if `revert-buffer-insert-file-contents-function' is
non-nil, it is called instead of rereading visited file contents.Frecover-file
Visit file FILE, but get contents from its last auto-save file.Frecover-session
Recover auto save files from a previous Emacs session.
This command first displays a Dired buffer showing you the
previous sessions that you could recover from.
To choose one, move point to the proper line and then type C-c C-c.
Then you'll be asked about a number of files to recover.Frecover-session-finish
Choose one saved session to recover auto-save files from.
This command is used in the special Dired buffer created by
\[recover-session].Fkill-some-buffers
For each buffer in LIST, ask whether to kill it.
LIST defaults to all existing live buffers.Fauto-save-mode
Toggle auto-saving of contents of current buffer.
With prefix argument ARG, turn auto-saving on if positive, else off.Frename-auto-save-file
Adjust current buffer's auto save file name for current conditions.
Also rename any existing auto save file, if it was made in this session.Fmake-auto-save-file-name
Return file name to use for auto-saves of current buffer.
Does not consider `auto-save-visited-file-name' as that variable is checked
before calling this function.  You can redefine this for customization.
See also `auto-save-file-name-p'.Fauto-save-file-name-p
Return non-nil if FILENAME can be yielded by `make-auto-save-file-name'.
FILENAME should lack slashes.  You can redefine this for customization.Fwildcard-to-regexp
Given a shell file name pattern WILDCARD, return an equivalent regexp.
The generated regexp will match a filename iff the filename
matches that wildcard according to shell rules.  Only wildcards known
by `sh' are supported.Vlist-directory-brief-switches
*Switches for `list-directory' to pass to `ls' for brief listing.Vlist-directory-verbose-switches
*Switches for `list-directory' to pass to `ls' for verbose listing.Ffile-expand-wildcards
Expand wildcard pattern PATTERN.
This returns a list of file names which match the pattern.

If PATTERN is written as an absolute relative file name,
the values are absolute also.

If PATTERN is written as a relative file name, it is interpreted
relative to the current default directory, `default-directory'.
The file names returned are normally also relative to the current
default directory.  However, if FULL is non-nil, they are absolute.Flist-directory
Display a list of files in or matching DIRNAME, a la `ls'.
DIRNAME is globbed by the shell if necessary.
Prefix arg (second arg if noninteractive) means supply -l switch to `ls'.
Actions controlled by variables `list-directory-brief-switches'
and `list-directory-verbose-switches'.Fshell-quote-wildcard-pattern
Quote characters special to the shell in PATTERN, leave wildcards alone.

PATTERN is assumed to represent a file-name wildcard suitable for the
underlying filesystem.  For Unix and GNU/Linux, the characters from the
set [ \t\n;<>&|()#$] are quoted with a backslash; for DOS/Windows, all
the parts of the pattern which don't include wildcard characters are
quoted with double quotes.
Existing quote characters in PATTERN are left alone, so you can pass
PATTERN that already quotes some of the special characters.Vinsert-directory-program
Absolute or relative name of the `ls' program used by `insert-directory'.Finsert-directory
Insert directory listing for FILE, formatted according to SWITCHES.
Leaves point after the inserted text.
SWITCHES may be a string of options, or a list of strings.
Optional third arg WILDCARD means treat FILE as shell wildcard.
Optional fourth arg FULL-DIRECTORY-P means file is a directory and
switches do not contain `d', so that a full listing is expected.

This works by running a directory listing program
whose name is in the variable `insert-directory-program'.
If WILDCARD, it also runs the shell specified by `shell-file-name'.Finsert-directory-safely
Insert directory listing for FILE, formatted according to SWITCHES.

Like `insert-directory', but if FILE does not exist, it inserts a
message to that effect instead of signaling an error.Vkill-emacs-query-functions
Functions to call with no arguments to query about killing Emacs.
If any of these functions returns nil, killing Emacs is cancelled.
`save-buffers-kill-emacs' (\[save-buffers-kill-emacs]) calls these functions,
but `kill-emacs', the low level primitive, does not.
See also `kill-emacs-hook'.Vconfirm-kill-emacs
How to ask for confirmation when leaving Emacs.
If nil, the default, don't ask at all.  If the value is non-nil, it should
be a predicate function such as `yes-or-no-p'.Fsave-buffers-kill-emacs
Offer to save each buffer, then kill this Emacs process.
With prefix arg, silently save all file-visiting buffers, then kill.Vpi
The value of Pi (3.1415926...)Ve
The value of e (2.7182818...)Vdegrees-to-radians
Degrees to radian conversion constantVradians-to-degrees
Radian to degree conversion constantFdegrees-to-radians
Convert ARG from degrees to radians.Fradians-to-degrees
Convert ARG from radians to degrees.Vformat-alist
List of information about understood file formats.
Elements are of the form (NAME DOC-STR REGEXP FROM-FN TO-FN MODIFY MODE-FN).

NAME    is a symbol, which is stored in `buffer-file-format'.

DOC-STR should be a single line providing more information about the
        format.  It is currently unused, but in the future will be shown to
        the user if they ask for more information.

REGEXP  is a regular expression to match against the beginning of the file;
        it should match only files in that format.  Use nil to avoid
        matching at all for formats for which this isn't appropriate to
        require explicit encoding/decoding.

FROM-FN is called to decode files in that format; it gets two args, BEGIN
        and END, and can make any modifications it likes, returning the new
        end.  It must make sure that the beginning of the file no longer
        matches REGEXP, or else it will get called again.
	Alternatively, FROM-FN can be a string, which specifies a shell command
	(including options) to be used as a filter to perform the conversion.

TO-FN   is called to encode a region into that format; it is passed three
        arguments: BEGIN, END, and BUFFER.  BUFFER is the original buffer that
        the data being written came from, which the function could use, for
        example, to find the values of local variables.  TO-FN should either
        return a list of annotations like `write-region-annotate-functions',
        or modify the region and return the new end.
	Alternatively, TO-FN can be a string, which specifies a shell command
	(including options) to be used as a filter to perform the conversion.

MODIFY, if non-nil, means the TO-FN wants to modify the region.  If nil,
        TO-FN will not make any changes but will instead return a list of
        annotations.

MODE-FN, if specified, is called when visiting a file with that format.
         It is called with a single positive argument, on the assumption
         that it turns on some Emacs mode.Fformat-encode-run-method
Translate using function or shell script METHOD the text from FROM to TO.
If METHOD is a string, it is a shell command;
otherwise, it should be a Lisp function.
BUFFER should be the buffer that the output originally came from.Fformat-decode-run-method
Decode using function or shell script METHOD the text from FROM to TO.
If METHOD is a string, it is a shell command; otherwise, it should be
a Lisp function.  Decoding is done for the given BUFFER.Fformat-annotate-function
Return annotations for writing region as FORMAT.
FORMAT is a symbol naming one of the formats defined in `format-alist',
it must be a single symbol, not a list like `buffer-file-format'.
FROM and TO delimit the region to be operated on in the current buffer.
ORIG-BUF is the original buffer that the data came from.

FORMAT-COUNT is an integer specifying how many times this function has
been called in the process of decoding ORIG-BUF.

This function works like a function on `write-region-annotate-functions':
it either returns a list of annotations, or returns with a different buffer
current, which contains the modified text to write.  In the latter case,
this function's value is nil.

For most purposes, consider using `format-encode-region' instead.Fformat-decode
Decode text from any known FORMAT.
FORMAT is a symbol appearing in `format-alist' or a list of such symbols,
or nil, in which case this function tries to guess the format of the data by
matching against the regular expressions in `format-alist'.  After a match is
found and the region decoded, the alist is searched again from the beginning
for another match.

Second arg LENGTH is the number of characters following point to operate on.
If optional third arg VISIT-FLAG is true, set `buffer-file-format'
to the list of formats used, and call any mode functions defined for those
formats.

Returns the new length of the decoded region.

For most purposes, consider using `format-decode-region' instead.Fformat-decode-buffer
Translate the buffer from some FORMAT.
If the format is not specified, this function attempts to guess.
`buffer-file-format' is set to the format used, and any mode-functions
for the format are called.Fformat-decode-region
Decode the region from some format.
Arg FORMAT is optional; if omitted the format will be determined by looking
for identifying regular expressions at the beginning of the region.Fformat-encode-buffer
Translate the buffer into FORMAT.
FORMAT defaults to `buffer-file-format'.  It is a symbol naming one of the
formats defined in `format-alist', or a list of such symbols.Fformat-encode-region
Translate the region into some FORMAT.
FORMAT defaults to `buffer-file-format', it is a symbol naming
one of the formats defined in `format-alist', or a list of such symbols.Fformat-write-file
Write current buffer into file FILENAME using some FORMAT.
Makes buffer visit that file and sets the format as the default for future
saves.  If the buffer is already visiting a file, you can specify a directory
name as FILENAME, to write a file of the same old name in that directory.Fformat-find-file
Find the file FILENAME using data format FORMAT.
If FORMAT is nil then do not do any format conversion.Fformat-insert-file
Insert the contents of file FILENAME using data format FORMAT.
If FORMAT is nil then do not do any format conversion.
The optional third and fourth arguments BEG and END specify
the part of the file to read.

The return value is like the value of `insert-file-contents':
a list (ABSOLUTE-FILE-NAME . SIZE).Fformat-read
Read and return the name of a format.
Return value is a list, like `buffer-file-format'; it may be nil.
Formats are defined in `format-alist'.  Optional arg is the PROMPT to use.Fformat-replace-strings
Do multiple replacements on the buffer.
ALIST is a list of (from . to) pairs, which should be proper arguments to
`search-forward' and `replace-match' respectively.
Optional 2nd arg REVERSE, if non-nil, means the pairs are (to . from), so that
you can use the same list in both directions if it contains only literal
strings.
Optional args BEG and END specify a region of the buffer on which to operate.Fformat-delq-cons
Remove the given CONS from LIST by side effect and return the new LIST.
Since CONS could be the first element of LIST, write
`(setq foo (format-delq-cons element foo))' to be sure of changing
the value of `foo'.Fformat-make-relatively-unique
Delete common elements of lists A and B, return as pair.
Compares using `equal'.Fformat-common-tail
Given two lists that have a common tail, return it.
Compares with `equal', and returns the part of A that is equal to the
equivalent part of B.  If even the last items of the two are not equal,
returns nil.Fformat-proper-list-p
Return t if LIST is a proper list.
A proper list is a list ending with a nil cdr, not with an atom Fformat-reorder
Arrange ITEMS to following partial ORDER.
Elements of ITEMS equal to elements of ORDER will be rearranged to follow the
ORDER.  Unmatched items will go last.Fformat-deannotate-region
Translate annotations in the region into text properties.
This sets text properties between FROM to TO as directed by the
TRANSLATIONS and NEXT-FN arguments.

NEXT-FN is a function that searches forward from point for an annotation.
It should return a list of 4 elements: (BEGIN END NAME POSITIVE).  BEGIN and
END are buffer positions bounding the annotation, NAME is the name searched
for in TRANSLATIONS, and POSITIVE should be non-nil if this annotation marks
the beginning of a region with some property, or nil if it ends the region.
NEXT-FN should return nil if there are no annotations after point.

The basic format of the TRANSLATIONS argument is described in the
documentation for the `format-annotate-region' function.  There are some
additional things to keep in mind for decoding, though:

When an annotation is found, the TRANSLATIONS list is searched for a
text-property name and value that corresponds to that annotation.  If the
text-property has several annotations associated with it, it will be used only
if the other annotations are also in effect at that point.  The first match
found whose annotations are all present is used.

The text property thus determined is set to the value over the region between
the opening and closing annotations.  However, if the text-property name has a
non-nil `format-list-valued' property, then the value will be consed onto the
surrounding value of the property, rather than replacing that value.

There are some special symbols that can be used in the "property" slot of
the TRANSLATIONS list: PARAMETER and FUNCTION (spelled in uppercase).
Annotations listed under the pseudo-property PARAMETER are considered to be
arguments of the immediately surrounding annotation; the text between the
opening and closing parameter annotations is deleted from the buffer but saved
as a string.  The surrounding annotation should be listed under the
pseudo-property FUNCTION.  Instead of inserting a text-property for this
annotation, the function listed in the VALUE slot is called to make whatever
changes are appropriate.  The function's first two arguments are the START and
END locations, and the rest of the arguments are any PARAMETERs found in that
region.

Any annotations that are found by NEXT-FN but not defined by TRANSLATIONS
are saved as values of the `unknown' text-property (which is list-valued).
The TRANSLATIONS list should usually contain an entry of the form
    (unknown (nil format-annotate-value))
to write these unknown annotations back into the file.Fformat-subtract-regions
Remove from the regions in MINUend the regions in SUBTRAhend.
A region is a dotted pair (from . to).  Both parameters are lists of
regions.  Each list must contain nonoverlapping, noncontiguous
regions, in descending order.  The result is also nonoverlapping,
noncontiguous, and in descending order.  The first element of MINUEND
can have a cdr of nil, indicating that the end of that region is not
yet known.Fformat-property-increment-region
Over the region between FROM and TO increment property PROP by amount DELTA.
DELTA may be negative.  If property PROP is nil anywhere
in the region, it is treated as though it were DEFAULT.Fformat-insert-annotations
Apply list of annotations to buffer as `write-region' would.
Inserts each element of the given LIST of buffer annotations at its
appropriate place.  Use second arg OFFSET if the annotations' locations are
not relative to the beginning of the buffer: annotations will be inserted
at their location-OFFSET+1 (ie, the offset is treated as the character number
of the first character in the buffer).Fformat-annotate-value
Return OLD and NEW as a (close . open) annotation pair.
Useful as a default function for TRANSLATIONS alist when the value of the text
property is the name of the annotation that you want to use, as it is for the
`unknown' text property.Fformat-annotate-region
Generate annotations for text properties in the region.
Searches for changes between FROM and TO, and describes them with a list of
annotations as defined by alist TRANSLATIONS and FORMAT-FN.  IGNORE lists text
properties not to consider; any text properties that are neither ignored nor
listed in TRANSLATIONS are warned about.
If you actually want to modify the region, give the return value of this
function to `format-insert-annotations'.

Format of the TRANSLATIONS argument:

Each element is a list whose car is a PROPERTY, and the following
elements are VALUES of that property followed by the names of zero or more
ANNOTATIONS.  Whenever the property takes on that value, the annotations
(as formatted by FORMAT-FN) are inserted into the file.
When the property stops having that value, the matching negated annotation
will be inserted (it may actually be closed earlier and reopened, if
necessary, to keep proper nesting).

If the property's value is a list, then each element of the list is dealt with
separately.

If a VALUE is numeric, then it is assumed that there is a single annotation
and each occurrence of it increments the value of the property by that number.
Thus, given the entry (left-margin (4 "indent")), if the left margin
changes from 4 to 12, two <indent> annotations will be generated.

If the VALUE is nil, then instead of annotations, a function should be
specified.  This function is used as a default: it is called for all
transitions not explicitly listed in the table.  The function is called with
two arguments, the OLD and NEW values of the property.  It should return
lists of annotations like `format-annotate-location' does.

    The same structure can be used in reverse for reading files.Fformat-annotate-location
Return annotation(s) needed at location LOC.
This includes any properties that change between LOC-1 and LOC.
If ALL is true, don't look at previous location, but generate annotations for
all non-nil properties.
Third argument IGNORE is a list of text-properties not to consider.
Use the TRANSLATIONS alist.

Return value is a vector of 3 elements:
1. List of names of the annotations to close
2. List of the names of annotations to open.
3. List of properties that were ignored or couldn't be annotated.Fformat-annotate-single-property-change
Return annotations for property PROP changing from OLD to NEW.
These are searched for in the translations alist TRANS.
If NEW does not appear in the list, but there is a default function, then that
function is called.
Annotations to open and to close are returned as a dotted pair.Fformat-annotate-atomic-property-change
Internal function annotate a single property change.
PROP-ALIST is the relevant segment of a TRANSLATIONS list.
OLD and NEW are the values.Vframe-creation-function
Window-system dependent function to call to create a new frame.
The window system startup file should set this to its frame creation
function, which should take an alist of parameters as its argument.Vinitial-frame-alist
*Alist of frame parameters for creating the initial X window frame.
You can set this in your `.emacs' file; for example,
 (setq initial-frame-alist '((top . 1) (left . 1) (width . 80) (height . 55)))
Parameters specified here supersede the values given in `default-frame-alist'.

If the value calls for a frame without a minibuffer, and you have not created
a minibuffer frame on your own, one is created according to
`minibuffer-frame-alist'.

You can specify geometry-related options for just the initial frame
by setting this variable in your `.emacs' file; however, they won't
take effect until Emacs reads `.emacs', which happens after first creating
the frame.  If you want the frame to have the proper geometry as soon
as it appears, you need to use this three-step process:
* Specify X resources to give the geometry you want.
* Set `default-frame-alist' to override these options so that they
  don't affect subsequent frames.
* Set `initial-frame-alist' in a way that matches the X resources,
  to override what you put in `default-frame-alist'.Vminibuffer-frame-alist
*Alist of frame parameters for initially creating a minibuffer frame.
You can set this in your `.emacs' file; for example,
 (setq minibuffer-frame-alist
   '((top . 1) (left . 1) (width . 80) (height . 2)))
Parameters specified here supersede the values given in
`default-frame-alist', for a minibuffer frame.Vpop-up-frame-alist
*Alist of frame parameters used when creating pop-up frames.
Pop-up frames are used for completions, help, and the like.
This variable can be set in your init file, like this:
  (setq pop-up-frame-alist '((width . 80) (height . 20)))
These supersede the values given in `default-frame-alist',
for pop-up frames.Vspecial-display-frame-alist
*Alist of frame parameters used when creating special frames.
Special frames are used for buffers whose names are in
`special-display-buffer-names' and for buffers whose names match
one of the regular expressions in `special-display-regexps'.
This variable can be set in your init file, like this:
  (setq special-display-frame-alist '((width . 80) (height . 20)))
These supersede the values given in `default-frame-alist'.Fspecial-display-popup-frame
Display BUFFER in its own frame, reusing an existing window if any.
Return the window chosen.
Currently we do not insist on selecting the window within its frame.
If ARGS is an alist, use it as a list of frame parameter specs.

Act on user's init file settings of frame parameters.
React to settings of `default-frame-alist', `initial-frame-alist' there.Fget-other-frame
Return some frame other than the current frame.
Create one if necessary.  Note that the minibuffer frame, if separate,
is not considered (see `next-frame').Fnext-multiframe-window
Select the next window, regardless of which frame it is on.Fprevious-multiframe-window
Select the previous window, regardless of which frame it is on.Fmake-frame-on-display
Make a frame on display DISPLAY.
The optional second argument PARAMETERS specifies additional frame parameters.Fmake-frame-command
Make a new frame, and select it if the terminal displays only one frame.Vbefore-make-frame-hook
Functions to run before a frame is created.Vafter-make-frame-functions
Functions to run after a frame is created.
The functions are run with one arg, the newly created frame.Vafter-setting-font-hook
Functions to run after a frame's font has been changed.Fmake-frame
Return a newly created frame displaying the current buffer.
Optional argument PARAMETERS is an alist of parameters for the new frame.
Each element of PARAMETERS should have the form (NAME . VALUE), for example:

 (name . STRING)	The frame should be named STRING.

 (width . NUMBER)	The frame should be NUMBER characters in width.
 (height . NUMBER)	The frame should be NUMBER text lines high.

You cannot specify either `width' or `height', you must use neither or both.

 (minibuffer . t)	The frame should have a minibuffer.
 (minibuffer . nil)	The frame should have no minibuffer.
 (minibuffer . only)	The frame should contain only a minibuffer.
 (minibuffer . WINDOW)	The frame should use WINDOW as its minibuffer window.

Before the frame is created (via `frame-creation-function'), functions on the
hook `before-make-frame-hook' are run.  After the frame is created, functions
on `after-make-frame-functions' are run with one arg, the newly created frame.Ffiltered-frame-list
Return a list of all live frames which satisfy PREDICATE.Fminibuffer-frame-list
Return a list of all frames with their own minibuffers.Fframes-on-display-list
Return a list of all frames on DISPLAY.
DISPLAY is a name of a display, a string of the form HOST:SERVER.SCREEN.
If DISPLAY is omitted or nil, it defaults to the selected frame's display.Fframep-on-display
Return the type of frames on DISPLAY.
DISPLAY may be a display name or a frame.  If it is a frame, its type is
returned.
If DISPLAY is omitted or nil, it defaults to the selected frame's display.
All frames on a given display are of the same type.Fframe-remove-geometry-params
Return the parameter list PARAM-LIST, but with geometry specs removed.
This deletes all bindings in PARAM-LIST for `top', `left', `width',
`height', `user-size' and `user-position' parameters.
Emacs uses this to avoid overriding explicit moves and resizings from
the user during startup.Vfocus-follows-mouse

Each element of the cdr is a list of the form (FRAME ALIST WINDOW-CONFIG),
where
  FRAME is a frame object,
  ALIST is an association list specifying some of FRAME's parameters, and
  WINDOW-CONFIG is a window configuration object for FRAME.Fset-frame-configuration

With arg, turn auto-raise mode on if and only if arg is positive.
Note that this controls Emacs's own auto-raise feature.
Some window managers allow you to enable auto-raise for certain windows.
You can use that for Emacs windows if you wish, but if you do,
that is beyond the control of Emacs and this command has no effect on it.Fauto-lower-mode
Toggle whether or not the selected frame should auto-lower.
With arg, turn auto-lower mode on if and only if arg is positive.
Note that this controls Emacs's own auto-lower feature.

Optional second arg non-nil means that redisplay should use COLS columns
but that the idea of the actual width of the frame should not be changed.
This function is provided only for compatibility with Emacs 18; new code
should use `set-frame-width instead'.Fset-screen-height

Help command.Ffunction-called-at-point
Return a function around point or else called by the list containing point.
If that doesn't give a function, return nil.Vsymbol-file-load-history-loaded
Non-nil means we have loaded the file `fns-VERSION.el' in `exec-directory'.
That file records the part of `load-history' for preloaded files,
which is cleared out before dumping to make Emacs smaller.Fload-symbol-file-load-history
Load the file `fns-VERSION.el' in `exec-directory' if not already done.
That file records the part of `load-history' for preloaded files,
which is cleared out before dumping to make Emacs smaller.Fsymbol-file
Return the input source from which FUNCTION was loaded.
The value is normally a string that was passed to `load':
either an absolute file name, or a library name
(with no directory name and no `.el' or `.elc' at the end).
It can also be nil, if the definition is not associated with any file.Fdescribe-function
Display the full documentation of FUNCTION (a symbol).Fvariable-at-point
Return the bound variable symbol found around point.
Return 0 if there is no such symbol.Fhelp-xref-on-pp
Add xrefs for symbols in `pp's output between FROM and TO.Fdescribe-variable
Display the full documentation of VARIABLE (a symbol).
Returns the documentation as a string, also.
If VARIABLE has a buffer-local value in BUFFER (default to the current buffer),
it is displayed along with the global value.Fdescribe-bindings
Show a list of all defined keys, and their definitions.
We put that list in a buffer, and display the buffer.

The optional argument PREFIX, if non-nil, should be a key sequence;
then we display only bindings that start with that prefix.
The optional argument BUFFER specifies which buffer's bindings
to display (default, the current buffer).Fwhere-is
Print message listing key sequences that invoke the command DEFINITION.
Argument is a command definition, usually a symbol with a function definition.
If INSERT (the prefix arg) is non-nil, insert the message in the buffer.Flocate-library
Show the precise file name of Emacs library LIBRARY.
This command searches the directories in `load-path' like `M-x load-library'
to find the file that `M-x load-library RET LIBRARY RET' would load.
Optional second arg NOSUFFIX non-nil means don't add suffixes `.elc' or `.el'
to the specified name LIBRARY.

If the optional third arg PATH is specified, that list of directories
is used instead of `load-path'.

When called from a program, the file name is normaly returned as a
string.  When run interactively, the argument INTERACTIVE-CALL is t,
and the file name is displayed in the echo area.Vhelp-highlight-p
*If non-nil, `help-make-xrefs' highlight cross-references.
Under a window system it highlights them with face defined by
`help-highlight-face'.Vhelp-highlight-face
Face used by `help-make-xrefs' to highlight cross-references.
Must be previously-defined.Vhelp-back-label
Label to use by `help-make-xrefs' for the go-back reference.Vhelp-xref-symbol-regexp
Regexp matching doc string references to symbols.

The words preceding the quoted symbol can be used in doc strings to
distinguish references to variables, functions and symbols.Vhelp-xref-mule-regexp
Regexp matching doc string references to MULE-related keywords.

It is usually nil, and is temporarily bound to an appropriate regexp
when help commands related to multilingual environment (e.g.,
`describe-coding-system') are invoked.Vhelp-xref-info-regexp
Regexp matching doc string references to an Info node.Fhelp-setup-xref
Invoked from commands using the "*Help*" buffer to install some xref info.

ITEM is a (FUNCTION . ARGS) pair appropriate for recreating the help
buffer after following a reference.  INTERACTIVE-P is non-nil if the
calling command was invoked interactively.  In this case the stack of
items for help buffer "back" buttons is cleared.Vhelp-xref-following
Non-nil when following a help cross-reference.Fhelp-make-xrefs
Parse and hyperlink documentation cross-references in the given BUFFER.

Find cross-reference information in a buffer and, if
`help-highlight-p' is non-nil, highlight it with face defined by
`help-highlight-face'; activate such cross references for selection
with `help-follow'.  Cross-references have the canonical form `...'
and the type of reference may be disambiguated by the preceding
word(s) used in `help-xref-symbol-regexp'.

If the variable `help-xref-mule-regexp' is non-nil, find also
cross-reference information related to multilingual environment
(e.g., coding-systems).  This variable is also used to disambiguate
the type of reference as the same way as `help-xref-symbol-regexp'.

A special reference `back' is made to return back through a stack of
help buffers.  Variable `help-back-label' specifies the text for
that.Fhelp-xref-button
Make a hyperlink for cross-reference text previously matched.

MATCH-NUMBER is the subexpression of interest in the last matched
regexp.  FUNCTION is a function to invoke when the button is
activated, applied to DATA.  DATA may be a single value or a list.
See `help-make-xrefs'.
If optional arg HELP-ECHO is supplied, it is used as a help string.Fhelp-insert-xref-button
Insert STRING and make a hyperlink from cross-reference text on it.

FUNCTION is a function to invoke when the button is activated, applied
to DATA.  DATA may be a single value or a list.  See `help-make-xrefs'.
If optional arg HELP-ECHO is supplied, it is used as a help string.Fhelp-xref-interned
Follow a hyperlink which appeared to be an arbitrary interned SYMBOL.

Both variable and function documentation are extracted into a single
help buffer.Fhelp-xref-mode
Do a `describe-mode' for the specified BUFFER.Fhelp-follow-mouse
Follow the cross-reference that you click on.Fhelp-xref-go-back
From BUFFER, go back to previous help buffer text using `help-xref-stack'.Fhelp-go-back
Invoke the [back] button (if any) in the Help mode buffer.Fhelp-follow
Follow cross-reference at POS, defaulting to point.

For the cross-reference format, see `help-make-xrefs'.Fhelp-next-ref
Find the next help cross-reference in the buffer.Fhelp-previous-ref
Find the previous help cross-reference in the buffer.Vtemp-buffer-max-height
*Maximum height of a window displaying a temporary buffer.
This is the maximum height (in text lines) which `resize-temp-buffer-window'
will give to a window displaying a temporary buffer.
It can also be a function which will be called with the object corresponding
to the buffer to be displayed as argument and should return an integer
positive number.Vtemp-buffer-resize-mode
Non-nil if Temp-Buffer-Resize mode is enabled.
See the command `temp-buffer-resize-mode' for a description of this minor-mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `temp-buffer-resize-mode'.Ftemp-buffer-resize-mode
Toggle the mode which makes windows smaller for temporary buffers.
With prefix argument ARG, turn the resizing of windows displaying temporary
buffers on if ARG is positive or off otherwise.
This makes the window the right height for its contents, but never
more than `temp-buffer-max-height' nor less than `window-min-height'.
This applies to `help', `apropos' and `completion' buffers, and some others.Vtemp-buffer-resize-mode-hook
Hook run at the end of function `temp-buffer-resize-mode'.Fresize-temp-buffer-window
Resize the current window to fit its contents.
Will not make it higher than `temp-buffer-max-height' nor smaller than
`window-min-height'.  Do nothing if it is the only window on its frame, if it
is not as wide as the frame or if some of the window's contents are scrolled
out of view.Vstandard-indent
*Default number of columns for margin-changing functions to indent.Vindent-line-function
Function to indent current line.Vtab-always-indent
*Controls the operation of the TAB key.
If t, hitting TAB always just indents the current line.
If nil, hitting TAB indents the current line if point is at the left margin
  or in the line's indentation, otherwise it insert a `real' tab character.Findent-according-to-mode
Indent line in proper way for current major mode.Findent-for-tab-command
Indent line in proper way for current major mode or insert a tab.
Depending on `tab-always-indent', either insert a tab or indent.
If initial point was within line's indentation, position after
the indentation.  Else stay at same point in text.
The function actually called to indent is determined by the value of
`indent-line-function'.Findent-rigidly
Indent all lines starting in the region sideways by ARG columns.
Called from a program, takes three arguments, START, END and ARG.Findent-line-to
Indent current line to COLUMN.
This function removes or adds spaces and tabs at beginning of line
only if necessary.  It leaves point at end of indentation.Fcurrent-left-margin
Return the left margin to use for this line.
This is the value of the buffer-local variable `left-margin' plus the value
of the `left-margin' text-property at the start of the line.Fmove-to-left-margin
Move to the left margin of the current line.
With optional argument, move forward N-1 lines first.
The column moved to is the one given by the `current-left-margin' function.
If the line's indentation appears to be wrong, and this command is called
interactively or with optional argument FORCE, it will be fixed.Findent-to-left-margin
Indent current line to the column given by `current-left-margin'.Fdelete-to-left-margin
Remove left margin indentation from a region.
This deletes to the column given by `current-left-margin'.
In no case will it delete non-whitespace.
Args FROM and TO are optional; default is the whole buffer.Fset-left-margin
Set the left margin of the region to WIDTH.
If `auto-fill-mode' is active, re-fill the region to fit the new margin.Fset-right-margin
Set the right margin of the region to WIDTH.
If `auto-fill-mode' is active, re-fill the region to fit the new margin.Falter-text-property
Programmatically change value of a text-property.
For each region between FROM and TO that has a single value for PROPERTY,
apply FUNCTION to that value and sets the property to the function's result.
Optional fifth argument OBJECT specifies the string or buffer to operate on.Fincrease-left-margin
Increase or decrease the left-margin of the region.
With no prefix argument, this adds `standard-indent' of indentation.
A prefix arg (optional third arg INC noninteractively) specifies the amount
to change the margin by, in characters.
If `auto-fill-mode' is active, re-fill the region to fit the new margin.Fdecrease-left-margin
Make the left margin of the region smaller.
With no prefix argument, decrease the indentation by `standard-indent'.
A prefix arg (optional third arg INC noninteractively) specifies the amount
to change the margin by, in characters.
If `auto-fill-mode' is active, re-fill the region to fit the new margin.Fincrease-right-margin
Increase the right-margin of the region.
With no prefix argument, increase the right margin by `standard-indent'.
A prefix arg (optional third arg INC noninteractively) specifies the amount
to change the margin by, in characters.  A negative argument decreases
the right margin width.
If `auto-fill-mode' is active, re-fill the region to fit the new margin.Fdecrease-right-margin
Make the right margin of the region smaller.
With no prefix argument, decrease the right margin by `standard-indent'.
A prefix arg (optional third arg INC noninteractively) specifies the amount
of width to remove, in characters.  A negative argument increases
the right margin width.
If `auto-fill-mode' is active, re-fills region to fit in new margin.Fbeginning-of-line-text
Move to the beginning of the text on this line.
With optional argument, move forward N-1 lines first.
From the beginning of the line, moves past the left-margin indentation, the
fill-prefix, and any indentation used for centering or right-justifying the
line, but does not move past any whitespace that was explicitly inserted 
(such as a tab used to indent the first line of a paragraph).Vindent-region-function
Short cut function to indent region using `indent-according-to-mode'.
A value of nil means really run `indent-according-to-mode' on each line.Findent-region
Indent each nonblank line in the region.
With prefix no argument, indent each line using `indent-according-to-mode',
or use `indent-region-function' to do the whole region if that's non-nil.
If there is a fill prefix, make each line start with the fill prefix.
With argument COLUMN, indent each line to that column.

When you call this from a program, START and END specify
the region to indent, and COLUMN specifies the indentation column.
If COLUMN is nil, then indent each line according to the mode.Findent-relative-maybe
Indent a new line like previous nonblank line.
If the previous nonblank line has no indent points beyond the
column point starts at, this command does nothing.

See also `indent-relative'.Findent-relative
Space out to under next indent point in previous nonblank line.
An indent point is a non-whitespace character following whitespace.
The following line shows the indentation points in this line.
    ^         ^    ^     ^   ^           ^      ^  ^    ^
If the previous nonblank line has no indent points beyond the
column point starts at, `tab-to-tab-stop' is done instead, unless
this command is invoked with a numeric argument, in which case it
does nothing.

See also `indent-relative-maybe'.Vtab-stop-list
*List of tab stop positions used by `tab-to-tab-stop'.
This should be a list of integers, ordered from smallest to largest.Vedit-tab-stops-map
Keymap used in `edit-tab-stops'.Vedit-tab-stops-buffer
Buffer whose tab stops are being edited--in case
the variable `tab-stop-list' is local in that buffer.Fedit-tab-stops
Edit the tab stops used by `tab-to-tab-stop'.
Creates a buffer *Tab Stops* containing text describing the tab stops.
A colon indicates a column where there is a tab stop.
You can add or remove colons and then do \<edit-tab-stops-map>\[edit-tab-stops-note-changes] to make changes take effect.Fedit-tab-stops-note-changes
Put edited tab stops into effect.Ftab-to-tab-stop
Insert spaces or tabs to next defined tab-stop column.
The variable `tab-stop-list' is a list of columns at which there are tab stops.
Use \[edit-tab-stops] to edit them interactively.Fmove-to-tab-stop
Move point to next defined tab-stop column.
The variable `tab-stop-list' is a list of columns at which there are tab stops.
Use \[edit-tab-stops] to edit them interactively.Vsearch-exit-option
*Non-nil means random control characters terminate incremental search.Vsearch-slow-window-lines
*Number of lines in slow search display windows.
These are the short windows used during incremental search on slow terminals.
Negative means put the slow search window at the top (normally it's at bottom)
and the value is minus the number of lines.Vsearch-slow-speed
*Highest terminal speed at which to use "slow" style incremental search.
This is the style where a one-line window is created to show the line
that the search has reached.Vsearch-upper-case
*If non-nil, upper case chars disable case fold searching.
That is, upper and lower case chars must match exactly.
This applies no matter where the chars come from, but does not
apply to chars in regexps that are prefixed with `\'.
If this value is `not-yanks', yanked text is always downcased.Vsearch-nonincremental-instead
*If non-nil, do a nonincremental search instead if exiting immediately.
Actually, `isearch-edit-string' is called to let you enter the search
string, and RET terminates editing and does a nonincremental search.Vsearch-whitespace-regexp
*If non-nil, regular expression to match a sequence of whitespace chars.
This applies to regular expression incremental search.
You might want to use something like "[ \t\r\n]+" instead.
In the Customization buffer, that is `[' followed by a space,
a tab, a carriage return (control-M), a newline, and `]+'.Vsearch-highlight
*Non-nil means incremental search highlights the current match.Vsearch-invisible
If t incremental search can match hidden text.
nil means don't match invisible text.
If the value is `open', if the text matched is made invisible by
an overlay having an `invisible' property and that overlay has a property
`isearch-open-invisible', then incremental search will show the contents.
(This applies when using `outline.el' and `hideshow.el'.)Visearch-hide-immediately
If non-nil, re-hide an invisible match right away.
This variable makes a difference when `search-invisible' is set to `open'.
It means that after search makes some invisible text visible
to show the match, it makes the text invisible again when the match moves.
Ordinarily the text becomes invisible again at the end of the search.Visearch-mode-hook
Function(s) to call after starting up an incremental search.Visearch-mode-end-hook
Function(s) to call after terminating an incremental search.Vsearch-ring
List of search string sequences.Vregexp-search-ring
List of regular expression search string sequences.Vsearch-ring-max
*Maximum length of search ring before oldest elements are thrown away.Vregexp-search-ring-max
*Maximum length of regexp search ring before oldest elements are thrown away.Vsearch-ring-yank-pointer
Index in `search-ring' of last string reused.
nil if none yet.Vregexp-search-ring-yank-pointer
Index in `regexp-search-ring' of last string reused.
nil if none yet.Vsearch-ring-update
*Non-nil if advancing or retreating in the search ring should cause search.
Default value, nil, means edit the string instead.Visearch-mode-map
Keymap for `isearch-mode'.Vminibuffer-local-isearch-map
Keymap for editing isearch strings in the minibuffer.Fisearch-forward
Do incremental search forward.
With a prefix argument, do an incremental regular expression search instead.
\<isearch-mode-map>
As you type characters, they add to the search string and are found.
The following non-printing keys are bound in `isearch-mode-map'.  

Type \[isearch-delete-char] to cancel characters from end of search string.
Type \[isearch-exit] to exit, leaving point at location found.
Type LFD (C-j) to match end of line.
Type \[isearch-repeat-forward] to search again forward, \[isearch-repeat-backward] to search again backward.
Type \[isearch-yank-word] to yank word from buffer onto end of search string and search for it.
Type \[isearch-yank-line] to yank rest of line onto end of search string and search for it.
Type \[isearch-yank-kill] to yank last killed text onto end of search string and search for it.
Type \[isearch-quote-char] to quote control character to search for it.
\[isearch-abort] while searching or when search has failed cancels input back to what has
 been found successfully.
\[isearch-abort] when search is successful aborts and moves point to starting point.

Type \[isearch-toggle-case-fold] to toggle search case-sensitivity.
Type \[isearch-toggle-regexp] to toggle regular-expression mode.
Type \[isearch-edit-string] to edit the search string in the minibuffer.

Also supported is a search ring of the previous 16 search strings.
Type \[isearch-ring-advance] to search for the next item in the search ring.
Type \[isearch-ring-retreat] to search for the previous item in the search ring.
Type \[isearch-complete] to complete the search string using the search ring.

If an input method is turned on in the current buffer, that input
method is also active while you are typing a characters to search.  To
toggle the input method, type \[isearch-toggle-input-method].  It
also toggles the input method in the current buffer.

To use a different input method for searching, type
\[isearch-toggle-specified-input-method], and specify an input method
you want to use.

The above keys, bound in `isearch-mode-map', are often controlled by 
 options; do M-x apropos on search-.* to find them.
Other control and meta characters terminate the search
 and are then executed normally (depending on `search-exit-option').
Likewise for function keys and mouse button events.

If this function is called non-interactively, it does not return to
the calling function until the search is done.Fisearch-forward-regexp
Do incremental search forward for regular expression.
With a prefix argument, do a regular string search instead.
Like ordinary incremental search except that your input
is treated as a regexp.  See \[isearch-forward] for more info.Fisearch-backward
Do incremental search backward.
With a prefix argument, do a regular expression search instead.
See \[isearch-forward] for more information.Fisearch-backward-regexp
Do incremental search backward for regular expression.
With a prefix argument, do a regular string search instead.
Like ordinary incremental search except that your input
is treated as a regexp.  See \[isearch-forward] for more info.Fisearch-mode
Start isearch minor mode.  Called by `isearch-forward', etc.

\{isearch-mode-map}Fisearch-update-ring
Add STRING to the beginning of the search ring.
REGEXP says which ring to use.Fisearch-exit
Exit search normally.
However, if this is the first command after starting incremental
search and `search-nonincremental-instead' is non-nil, do a
nonincremental search instead via `isearch-edit-string'.Fisearch-edit-string
Edit the search string in the minibuffer.
The following additional command keys are active while editing.
\<minibuffer-local-isearch-map>
\[exit-minibuffer] to resume incremental searching with the edited string.
\[isearch-nonincremental-exit-minibuffer] to do one nonincremental search.
\[isearch-forward-exit-minibuffer] to resume isearching forward.
\[isearch-reverse-exit-minibuffer] to resume isearching backward.
\[isearch-ring-advance-edit] to replace the search string with the next item in the search ring.
\[isearch-ring-retreat-edit] to replace the search string with the previous item in the search ring.
\[isearch-complete-edit] to complete the search string using the search ring.
\<isearch-mode-map>
If first char entered is \[isearch-yank-word], then do word search instead.Fisearch-cancel
Terminate the search and go back to the starting point.Fisearch-abort
Abort incremental search mode if searching is successful, signaling quit.
Otherwise, revert to previous successful search and continue searching.
Use `isearch-exit' to quit without signaling.Fisearch-repeat-forward
Repeat incremental search forwards.Fisearch-repeat-backward
Repeat incremental search backwards.Fisearch-toggle-regexp
Toggle regexp searching on or off.Fisearch-toggle-case-fold
Toggle case folding in searching on or off.Fisearch-delete-char
Discard last input item and move point back.  
If no previous match was done, just beep.Fisearch-yank-string
Pull STRING into search string.Fisearch-yank-kill
Pull string from kill ring into search string.Fisearch-yank-x-selection
Pull current X selection into search string.Fisearch-mouse-2
Handle mouse-2 in Isearch mode.
For a click in the echo area, invoke `isearch-yank-x-selection'.
Otherwise invoke whatever mouse-2 is bound to outside of Isearch.Fisearch-yank-word
Pull next word from buffer into search string.Fisearch-yank-line
Pull rest of line from buffer into search string.Fisearch-*-char
Handle * and ? specially in regexps.Fisearch-|-char
If in regexp search, jump to the barrier.Fisearch-other-meta-char
Exit the search normally and reread this key sequence.
But only if `search-exit-option' is non-nil, the default.
If it is the symbol `edit', the search string is edited in the minibuffer
and the meta character is unread so that it applies to editing the string.Fisearch-quote-char
Quote special characters for incremental search.Fisearch-return-char
Convert return into newline for incremental search.
Obsolete.Fisearch-printing-char
Add this ordinary printing character to the search string and search.Fisearch-whitespace-chars

If you want to search for just a space, type \[quoted-insert] SPC.Fisearch-ring-advance
Advance to the next search string in the ring.Fisearch-ring-retreat
Retreat to the previous search string in the ring.Fisearch-ring-advance-edit
Insert the next element of the search history into the minibuffer.
With prefix arg N, insert the Nth element.Fisearch-ring-retreat-edit
Insert the previous element of the search history into the minibuffer.
With prefix arg N, insert the Nth element.Fisearch-complete
Complete the search string from the strings on the search ring.
The completed string is then editable in the minibuffer.
If there is no completion possible, say so and continue searching.Fisearch-complete-edit
Same as `isearch-complete' except in the minibuffer.Fisearch-intersects-p
Return t if regions START0..END0 and START1..END1 intersect.Fisearch-range-invisible
Return t if all the text from BEG to END is invisible.Fisearch-no-upper-case-p
Return t if there are no upper case chars in STRING.
If REGEXP-FLAG is non-nil, disregard letters preceded by `\' (but not `\\')
since they have special meaning in a regexp.Visearch-lazy-highlight
*Controls the lazy-highlighting during incremental searches.
When non-nil, all text in the buffer matching the current search
string is highlighted lazily (see `isearch-lazy-highlight-initial-delay'
and `isearch-lazy-highlight-interval').Visearch-lazy-highlight-cleanup
*Controls whether to remove extra highlighting after a search.
If this is nil, extra highlighting can be "manually" removed with
\[isearch-lazy-highlight-cleanup].Visearch-lazy-highlight-initial-delay
*Seconds to wait before beginning to lazily highlight all matches.Visearch-lazy-highlight-interval
*Seconds between lazily highlighting successive matches.Visearch-lazy-highlight-max-at-a-time
*Maximum matches to highlight at a time (for `isearch-lazy-highlight').
Larger values may reduce isearch's responsiveness to user input;
smaller values make matches highlight slowly.
A value of nil means highlight all matches.Fisearch-lazy-highlight-cleanup
Stop lazy highlighting and remove extra highlighting from current buffer.
FORCE non-nil means do it whether or not `isearch-lazy-highlight-cleanup'
is nil.  This function is called when exiting an incremental search if
`isearch-lazy-highlight-cleanup' is non-nil.Fisearch-lazy-highlight-new-loop
Cleanup any previous `isearch-lazy-highlight' loop and begin a new one.
This happens when `isearch-update' is invoked (which can cause the
search string to change or the window to scroll).Fisearch-lazy-highlight-search
Search ahead for the next or previous match, for lazy highlighting.
Attempt to do the search exactly the way the pending isearch would.Fisearch-lazy-highlight-update
Update highlighting of other matches for current search.Fisearch-resume
Resume an incremental search.
SEARCH is the string or regexp searched for.
REGEXP non-nil means the resumed search was a regexp search.
WORD non-nil means resume a word search.
FORWARD non-nil means resume a forward search.
MESSAGE is the echo-area message recorded for the search resumed.
CASE-FOLD non-nil means the search was case-insensitive.F5x5
Play 5x5.

The object of 5x5 is very simple, by moving around the grid and flipping
squares you must fill the grid.

5x5 keyboard bindings are:
\<5x5-mode-map>
Flip                      \[5x5-flip-current] 
Move up                   \[5x5-up]           
Move down                 \[5x5-down]         
Move left                 \[5x5-left]         
Move right                \[5x5-right]        
Start new game            \[5x5-new-game]
New game with random grid \[5x5-randomize]
Random cracker            \[5x5-crack-randomly]
Mutate current cracker    \[5x5-crack-mutating-current]
Mutate best cracker       \[5x5-crack-mutating-best]
Mutate xor cracker        \[5x5-crack-xor-mutate]

Attempt to crack 5x5 using random solutions.F5x5-crack-mutating-current
Attempt to crack 5x5 by mutating the current solution.F5x5-crack-mutating-best
Attempt to crack 5x5 by mutating the best solution.F5x5-crack-xor-mutate
Attempt to crack 5x5 by xor the current and best solution and then
mutating the result.F5x5-crack
Attempt to find a solution for 5x5.

5x5-crack takes the argument BREEDER which should be a function that takes
two parameters, the first will be a grid vector array that is the current
solution and the second will be the best solution so far. The function
should return a grid vector array that is the new solution.Fada-add-extensions
Define SPEC and BODY as being valid extensions for Ada files.
Going from body to spec with `ff-find-other-file' used these
extensions.
SPEC and BODY are two regular expressions that must match against the file
nameFada-mode
Ada mode is the major mode for editing Ada code.

Bindings are as follows: (Note: 'LFD' is control-j.)

 Indent line                                          '\[ada-tab]'
 Indent line, insert newline and indent the new line. '\[newline-and-indent]'

 Re-format the parameter-list point is in             '\[ada-format-paramlist]'
 Indent all lines in region                           '\[ada-indent-region]'

 Adjust case of identifiers and keywords in region    '\[ada-adjust-case-region]'
 Adjust case of identifiers and keywords in buffer    '\[ada-adjust-case-buffer]'

 Fill comment paragraph, justify and append postfix   '\[fill-paragraph]'

 Next func/proc/task '\[ada-next-procedure]'  Previous func/proc/task '\[ada-previous-procedure]'
 Next package        '\[ada-next-package]'  Previous package        '\[ada-previous-package]'

 Goto matching start of current 'end ...;'            '\[ada-move-to-start]'
 Goto end of current block                            '\[ada-move-to-end]'

Comments are handled using standard GNU Emacs conventions, including:
 Start a comment                                      '\[indent-for-comment]'
 Comment region                                       '\[comment-region]'
 Uncomment region                                     '\[ada-uncomment-region]'
 Continue comment on next line                        '\[indent-new-comment-line]'

If you use imenu.el:
 Display index-menu of functions & procedures         '\[imenu]'

If you use find-file.el:
 Switch to other file (Body <-> Spec)                 '\[ff-find-other-file]'
                                                   or '\[ff-mouse-find-other-file]
 Switch to other file in other window                 '\[ada-ff-other-window]'
                                                   or '\[ff-mouse-find-other-file-other-window]
 If you use this function in a spec and no body is available, it gets created with body stubs.

If you use ada-xref.el:
 Goto declaration:          '\[ada-point-and-xref]' on the identifier
                         or '\[ada-goto-declaration]' with point on the identifier
 Complete identifier:       '\[ada-complete-identifier]'.Fada-header
Insert a descriptive header at the top of the file.Vadd-log-full-name
*Full name of user, for inclusion in ChangeLog daily headers.
This defaults to the value returned by the function `user-full-name'.Vadd-log-mailing-address
*Electronic mail address of user, for inclusion in ChangeLog daily headers.
This defaults to the value of `user-mail-address'.Fprompt-for-change-log-name
Prompt for a change log name.Ffind-change-log
Find a change log file for \[add-change-log-entry] and return the name.

Optional arg FILE-NAME specifies the file to use.
If FILE-NAME is nil, use the value of `change-log-default-name'.
If 'change-log-default-name' is nil, behave as though it were 'ChangeLog'
(or whatever we use on this operating system).

If 'change-log-default-name' contains a leading directory component, then
simply find it in the current directory.  Otherwise, search in the current
directory and its successive parents for a file so named.

Once a file is found, `change-log-default-name' is set locally in the
current buffer to the complete file name.
Optional arg BUFFER-FILE overrides `buffer-file-name'.Fadd-change-log-entry
Find change log file and add an entry for today.
Optional arg WHOAMI (interactive prefix) non-nil means prompt for user
name and site.

Second arg is FILE-NAME of change log.  If nil, uses `change-log-default-name'.
Third arg OTHER-WINDOW non-nil means visit in other window.
Fourth arg NEW-ENTRY non-nil means always create a new entry at the front;
never append to an existing entry.  Option `add-log-keep-changes-together'
otherwise affects whether a new entry is created.

Today's date is calculated according to `change-log-time-zone-rule' if
non-nil, otherwise in local time.Fadd-change-log-entry-other-window
Find change log file in other window and add an entry for today.
Optional arg WHOAMI (interactive prefix) non-nil means prompt for user
name and site.
Second optional arg FILE-NAME is file name of change log.
If nil, use `change-log-default-name'.

Affected by the same options as `add-change-log-entry'.Fchange-log-mode
Major mode for editing change logs; like Indented Text Mode.
Prevents numeric backups and sets `left-margin' to 8 and `fill-column' to 74.
New log entries are usually made with \[add-change-log-entry] or \[add-change-log-entry-other-window].
Each entry behaves as a paragraph, and the entries for one day as a page.
Runs `change-log-mode-hook'.Vadd-log-lisp-like-modes
*Modes that look like Lisp to `add-log-current-defun'.Vadd-log-c-like-modes
*Modes that look like C to `add-log-current-defun'.Vadd-log-tex-like-modes
*Modes that look like TeX to `add-log-current-defun'.Fadd-log-current-defun
Return name of function definition point is in, or nil.

Understands C, Lisp, LaTeX ("functions" are chapters, sections, ...),
Texinfo (@node titles) and Perl.

Other modes are handled by a heuristic that looks in the 10K before
point for uppercase headings starting in the first column or
identifiers followed by `:' or `='.  See variables
`add-log-current-defun-header-regexp' and
`add-log-current-defun-function'

Has a preference of looking backwards.Fchange-log-merge
Merge the contents of ChangeLog file OTHER-LOG with this buffer.
Both must be found in Change Log mode (since the merging depends on
the appropriate motion commands).

Entries are inserted in chronological order.  Both the current and
old-style time formats for entries are supported.Fchange-log-redate
Fix any old-style date entries in the current log file to default format.Vad-redefinition-action
*Defines what to do with redefinitions during Advice de/activation.
Redefinition occurs if a previously activated function that already has an
original definition associated with it gets redefined and then de/activated.
In such a case we can either accept the current definition as the new
original definition, discard the current definition and replace it with the
old original, or keep it and raise an error.  The values `accept', `discard',
`error' or `warn' govern what will be done.  `warn' is just like `accept' but
it additionally prints a warning message.  All other values will be
interpreted as `error'.Vad-default-compilation-action
*Defines whether to compile advised definitions during activation.
A value of `always' will result in unconditional compilation, `never' will
always avoid compilation, `maybe' will compile if the byte-compiler is already
loaded, and `like-original' will compile if the original definition of the
advised function is compiled or a built-in function.  Every other value will
be interpreted as `maybe'.  This variable will only be considered if the
COMPILE argument of `ad-activate' was supplied as nil.Fad-add-advice
Add a piece of ADVICE to FUNCTION's list of advices in CLASS.
If FUNCTION already has one or more pieces of advice of the specified
CLASS then POSITION determines where the new piece will go.  The value
of POSITION can either be `first', `last' or a number where 0 corresponds
to `first'.  Numbers outside the range will be mapped to the closest
extreme position.  If there was already a piece of ADVICE with the same
name, then the position argument will be ignored and the old advice
will be overwritten with the new one.
    If the FUNCTION was not advised already, then its advice info will be
initialized.  Redefining a piece of advice whose name is part of the cache-id
will clear the cache.Fdefadvice
Define a piece of advice for FUNCTION (a symbol).
The syntax of `defadvice' is as follows:

  (defadvice FUNCTION (CLASS NAME [POSITION] [ARGLIST] FLAG...)
    [DOCSTRING] [INTERACTIVE-FORM]
    BODY... )

FUNCTION ::= Name of the function to be advised.
CLASS ::= `before' | `around' | `after' | `activation' | `deactivation'.
NAME ::= Non-nil symbol that names this piece of advice.
POSITION ::= `first' | `last' | NUMBER. Optional, defaults to `first',
    see also `ad-add-advice'.
ARGLIST ::= An optional argument list to be used for the advised function
    instead of the argument list of the original.  The first one found in
    before/around/after-advices will be used.
FLAG ::= `protect'|`disable'|`activate'|`compile'|`preactivate'|`freeze'.
    All flags can be specified with unambiguous initial substrings.
DOCSTRING ::= Optional documentation for this piece of advice.
INTERACTIVE-FORM ::= Optional interactive form to be used for the advised
    function.  The first one found in before/around/after-advices will be used.
BODY ::= Any s-expression.

Semantics of the various flags:
`protect': The piece of advice will be protected against non-local exits in
any code that precedes it.  If any around-advice of a function is protected
then automatically all around-advices will be protected (the complete onion).

`activate': All advice of FUNCTION will be activated immediately if
FUNCTION has been properly defined prior to this application of `defadvice'.

`compile': In conjunction with `activate' specifies that the resulting
advised function should be compiled.

`disable': The defined advice will be disabled, hence, it will not be used
during activation until somebody enables it.

`preactivate': Preactivates the advised FUNCTION at macro-expansion/compile
time.  This generates a compiled advised definition according to the current
advice state that will be used during activation if appropriate.  Only use
this if the `defadvice' gets actually compiled.

`freeze': Expands the `defadvice' into a redefining `defun/defmacro' according
to this particular single advice.  No other advice information will be saved.
Frozen advices cannot be undone, they behave like a hard redefinition of
the advised function.  `freeze' implies `activate' and `preactivate'.  The
documentation of the advised function can be dumped onto the `DOC' file
during preloading.

See Info node `(elisp)Advising Functions' for comprehensive documentation.Falign
Attempt to align a region based on a set of alignment rules.
BEG and END mark the region.  If BEG and END are specifically set to
nil (this can only be done programmatically), the beginning and end of
the current alignment section will be calculated based on the location
of point, and the value of `align-region-separate' (or possibly each
rule's `separate' attribute).

If SEPARATE is non-nil, it overrides the value of
`align-region-separate' for all rules, except those that have their
`separate' attribute set.

RULES and EXCLUDE-RULES, if either is non-nil, will replace the
default rule lists defined in `align-rules-list' and
`align-exclude-rules-list'.  See `align-rules-list' for more details
on the format of these lists.Falign-regexp
Align the current region using an ad-hoc rule read from the minibuffer.
BEG and END mark the limits of the region.  This function will prompt
for the REGEXP to align with.  If no prefix arg was specified, you
only need to supply the characters to be lined up and any preceding
whitespace is replaced.  If a prefix arg was specified, the full
regexp with parenthesized whitespace should be supplied; it will also
prompt for which parenthesis GROUP within REGEXP to modify, the amount
of SPACING to use, and whether or not to REPEAT the rule throughout
the line.  See `align-rules-list' for more information about these
options.

For example, let's say you had a list of phone numbers, and wanted to
align them so that the opening parentheses would line up:

    Fred (123) 456-7890
    Alice (123) 456-7890
    Mary-Anne (123) 456-7890
    Joe (123) 456-7890

There is no predefined rule to handle this, but you could easily do it
using a REGEXP like "(". All you would have to do is to mark the
region, call `align-regexp' and type in that regular expression.Falign-entire
Align the selected region as if it were one alignment section.
BEG and END mark the extent of the region.  If RULES or EXCLUDE-RULES
is set to a list of rules (see `align-rules-list'), it can be used to
override the default alignment rules that would have been used to
align that section.Falign-current
Call `align' on the current alignment section.
This function assumes you want to align only the current section, and
so saves you from having to specify the region.  If RULES or
EXCLUDE-RULES is set to a list of rules (see `align-rules-list'), it
can be used to override the default alignment rules that would have
been used to align that section.Falign-highlight-rule
Highlight the whitespace which a given rule would have modified.
BEG and END mark the extent of the region.  TITLE identifies the rule
that should be highlighted.  If RULES or EXCLUDE-RULES is set to a
list of rules (see `align-rules-list'), it can be used to override the
default alignment rules that would have been used to identify the text
to be colored.Falign-unhighlight-rule
Remove any highlighting that was added by `align-highlight-rule'.Falign-newline-and-indent
A replacement function for `newline-and-indent', aligning as it goes.Fange-ftp-reread-dir
Reread remote directory DIR to update the directory cache.
The implementation of remote ftp file names caches directory contents
for speed.  Therefore, when new remote files are created, Emacs
may not know they exist.  You can use this command to reread a specific
directory, so that Emacs will know its current contents.Fanimate-string
Display STRING starting at position VPOS, HPOS, using animation.
The characters start at randomly chosen places,
and all slide in parallel to their final positions,
passing through `animate-n-steps' positions before the final ones.
If HPOS is nil (or omitted), center the string horizontally
in the current window.Fanimate-sequence
Display strings from LIST-OF-STRING with animation in a new buffer.
Strings will be separated from each other by SPACE lines.Fanimate-birthday-present
Display Sarah's birthday present in a new buffer.Fansi-color-for-comint-mode-on
Set `ansi-color-for-comint-mode' to t.Fansi-color-process-output
Maybe translate SGR control sequences of comint output into text-properties.

Depending on variable `ansi-color-for-comint-mode' the comint output is
either not processed, SGR control sequences are filtered using
`ansi-color-filter-region', or SGR control sequences are translated into
text-properties using `ansi-color-apply-on-region'.

The comint output is assumed to lie between the marker
`comint-last-output-start' and the process-mark.

This is a good function to put in `comint-output-filter-functions'.Fantlr-show-makefile-rules
Show Makefile rules for all grammar files in the current directory.
If the `major-mode' of the current buffer has the value `makefile-mode',
the rules are directory inserted at point.  Otherwise, a *Help* buffer
is shown with the rules which are also put into the `kill-ring' for
\[yank].

This command considers import/export vocabularies and grammar
inheritance and provides a value for the "-glib" option if necessary.
Customize variable `antlr-makefile-specification' for the appearance of
the rules.

If the file for a super-grammar cannot be determined, special file names
are used according to variable `antlr-unknown-file-formats' and a
commentary with value `antlr-help-unknown-file-text' is added.  The
*Help* buffer always starts with the text in `antlr-help-rules-intro'.Fantlr-mode
Major mode for editing ANTLR grammar files.
\{antlr-mode-map}Fantlr-set-tabs
Use ANTLR's convention for TABs according to `antlr-tab-offset-alist'.
Used in `antlr-mode'.  Also a useful function in `java-mode-hook'.Vappt-issue-message
*Non-nil means check for appointments in the diary buffer.
To be detected, the diary entry must have the time
as the first thing on a line.Vappt-message-warning-time
*Time in minutes before an appointment that the warning begins.Vappt-audible
*Non-nil means beep to indicate appointment.Vappt-visible
*Non-nil means display appointment message in echo area.Vappt-display-mode-line
*Non-nil means display minutes to appointment and time on the mode line.Vappt-msg-window
*Non-nil means display appointment message in another window.Vappt-display-duration
*The number of seconds an appointment message is displayed.Vappt-display-diary
*Non-nil means to display the next days diary on the screen. 
This will occur at midnight when the appointment list is updated.Fappt-add
Add an appointment for the day at NEW-APPT-TIME and issue message NEW-APPT-MSG.
The time should be in either 24 hour format or am/pm format.Fappt-delete
Delete an appointment from the list of appointments.Fappt-make-list
Create the appointments list from todays diary buffer.
The time must be at the beginning of a line for it to be
put in the appointments list.
  02/23/89
    12:00pm lunch
   Wednesday
     10:00am group meeting
We assume that the variables DATE and NUMBER
hold the arguments that `list-diary-entries' received.
They specify the range of dates that the diary is being processed for.Fapropos-mode
Major mode for following hyperlinks in output of apropos commands.

\{apropos-mode-map}Fapropos-variable
Show user variables that match REGEXP.
With optional prefix DO-ALL or if `apropos-do-all' is non-nil, also show
normal variables.Fapropos-command
Show commands (interactively callable functions) that match APROPOS-REGEXP.
With optional prefix DO-ALL, or if `apropos-do-all' is non-nil, also show
noninteractive functions.

If VAR-PREDICATE is non-nil, show only variables, and only those that
satisfy the predicate VAR-PREDICATE.Fapropos
Show all bound symbols whose names match APROPOS-REGEXP.
With optional prefix DO-ALL or if `apropos-do-all' is non-nil, also
show unbound symbols and key bindings, which is a little more
time-consuming.  Returns list of symbols and documentation found.Fapropos-value
Show all symbols whose value's printed image matches APROPOS-REGEXP.
With optional prefix DO-ALL or if `apropos-do-all' is non-nil, also looks
at the function and at the names and values of properties.
Returns list of symbols and values found.Fapropos-documentation
Show symbols whose documentation contain matches for APROPOS-REGEXP.
With optional prefix DO-ALL or if `apropos-do-all' is non-nil, also use
documentation that is not stored in the documentation file and show key
bindings.
Returns list of symbols and documentation found.Farchive-mode
Major mode for viewing an archive file in a dired-like way.
You can move around using the usual cursor motion commands.
Letters no longer insert themselves.
Type `e' to pull a file out of the archive and into its own buffer;
or click mouse-2 on the file's line in the archive mode buffer.

If you edit a sub-file of this archive (as with the `e' command) and
save it, the contents of that buffer will be saved back into the
archive.

\{archive-mode-map}Farray-mode
Major mode for editing arrays.

  Array mode is a specialized mode for editing arrays.  An array is
considered to be a two-dimensional set of strings.  The strings are
NOT recognized as integers or real numbers.

  The array MUST reside at the top of the buffer.

  TABs are not respected, and may be converted into spaces at any time.
Setting the variable 'array-respect-tabs to non-nil will prevent TAB conversion,
but will cause many functions to give errors if they encounter one.

  Upon entering array mode, you will be prompted for the values of
several variables.  Others will be calculated based on the values you
supply.  These variables are all local the the buffer.  Other buffer
in array mode may have different values assigned to the variables.
The variables are:

Variables you assign:
     array-max-row:          The number of rows in the array.
     array-max-column:       The number of columns in the array.
     array-columns-per-line: The number of columns in the array per line of buffer.
     array-field-width:      The width of each field, in characters.
     array-rows-numbered:    A logical variable describing whether to ignore
                       row numbers in the buffer.

Variables which are calculated:
     array-line-length:      The number of characters in a buffer line.
     array-lines-per-row:    The number of buffer lines used to display each row.

  The following commands are available (an asterisk indicates it may
take a numeric prefix argument):

    *  	\<array-mode-map>\[array-forward-column]	  Move forward one column.
    *  	\[array-backward-column]	  Move backward one column.
    *  	\[array-next-row]	  Move down one row.
    *  	\[array-previous-row]	  Move up one row.

    *   \[array-copy-forward]	  Copy the current field into the column to the right.
    *   \[array-copy-backward]	  Copy the current field into the column to the left.
    *   \[array-copy-down]	  Copy the current field into the row below.
    *   \[array-copy-up]	  Copy the current field into the row above.

    *   \[array-copy-column-forward]   Copy the current column into the column to the right.
    *   \[array-copy-column-backward]   Copy the current column into the column to the left.
    *   \[array-copy-row-down]   Copy the current row into the row below.
    *   \[array-copy-row-up]   Copy the current row into the row above.

        \[array-fill-rectangle]   Copy the field at mark into every cell with row and column
                  between that of point and mark.

	\[array-what-position]	  Display the current array row and column.
	\[array-goto-cell]	  Go to a particular array cell.

	\[array-make-template]	  Make a template for a new array.
	\[array-reconfigure-rows]	  Reconfigure the array.
        \[array-expand-rows]   Expand the array (remove row numbers and
                  newlines inside rows)

        \[array-display-local-variables]   Display the current values of local variables.

Entering array mode calls the function `array-mode-hook'.Fartist-mode
Toggle artist mode. With arg, turn artist mode on if arg is positive.
Artist lets you draw lines, squares, rectangles and poly-lines, ellipses
and circles with your mouse and/or keyboard.

How to quit artist mode

		  `artist-vaporize-fuzziness'.

		* Cut copies, then clears the rectangle/square.

		* When drawing lines or poly-lines, you can set arrows.
		  See below under ``Arrows'' for more info.

		* The mode line shows the currently selected drawing operation.
		  In addition, if it has an asterisk (*) at the end, you
		  are currently drawing something.

 When entering artist-mode, the hook `artist-mode-init-hook' is called.
 When quitting artist-mode, the hook `artist-mode-exit-hook' is called.


Keymap summary

\{artist-mode-map}Fasm-mode
Major mode for editing typical assembler code.
Features a private abbrev table and the following bindings:

\[asm-colon]	outdent a preceding label, tab to next tab stop.
\[tab-to-tab-stop]	tab to next tab stop.
\[asm-newline]	newline, then tab to next tab stop.
\[asm-comment]	smart placement of assembler comments.

The character used for making comments is set by the variable
`asm-comment-char' (which defaults to `?\;').

Alternatively, you may set this variable in `asm-mode-set-comment-hook',
which is called near the beginning of mode initialization.

Turning on Asm mode runs the hook `asm-mode-hook' at the end of initialization.

Special commands:
\{asm-mode-map}
Vauto-show-mode
Obsolete.Fauto-show-mode
This command is obsolete.Vautoarg-mode
Toggle Autoarg mode on or off.
See the command `autoarg-mode' for a description of this minor-mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `autoarg-mode'.Fautoarg-mode
Toggle Autoarg minor mode globally.
With ARG, turn Autoarg mode on if ARG is positive, off otherwise.
\<autoarg-mode-map>
In Autoarg mode digits are bound to `digit-argument' -- i.e. they
supply prefix arguments as C-DIGIT and M-DIGIT normally do -- and
C-DIGIT inserts DIGIT.  \[autoarg-terminate] terminates the prefix sequence
and inserts the digits of the autoarg sequence into the buffer.
Without a numeric prefix arg the normal binding of \[autoarg-terminate] is
invoked, i.e. what it would be with Autoarg mode off.

For example:
`6 9 \[autoarg-terminate]' inserts `69' into the buffer, as does `C-6 C-9'.
`6 9 a' inserts 69 `a's into the buffer.
`6 9 \[autoarg-terminate] \[autoarg-terminate]' inserts `69' into the buffer and
then invokes the normal binding of \[autoarg-terminate].
`C-u \[autoarg-terminate]' invokes the normal binding of \[autoarg-terminate] four times.

\{autoarg-mode-map}Vautoarg-kp-mode
Toggle Autoarg-Kp mode on or off.
See the command `autoarg-kp-mode' for a description of this minor-mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `autoarg-kp-mode'.Fautoarg-kp-mode
Toggle Autoarg-KP minor mode globally.
With ARG, turn Autoarg mode on if ARG is positive, off otherwise.
\<autoarg-kp-mode-map>
This is similar to \[autoarg-mode] but rebinds the keypad keys `kp-1'
&c to supply digit arguments.

\{autoarg-kp-mode-map}Fautoconf-mode
Major mode for editing Autoconf configure.in files.Fauto-insert
Insert default contents into new files if variable `auto-insert' is non-nil.
Matches the visited file name against the elements of `auto-insert-alist'.Fdefine-auto-insert
Associate CONDITION with (additional) ACTION in `auto-insert-alist'.
Optional AFTER means to insert action after all existing actions for CONDITION,
or if CONDITION had no actions, after all other CONDITIONs.Vauto-insert-mode
Toggle Auto-Insert mode on or off.
See the command `auto-insert-mode' for a description of this minor-mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `auto-insert-mode'.Fauto-insert-mode
Toggle Auto-insert mode.
With prefix ARG, turn Auto-insert mode on if and only if ARG is positive.
Returns the new status of Auto-insert mode (non-nil means on).

When Auto-insert mode is enabled, when new files are created you can
insert a template for the file depending on the mode of the buffer.Fupdate-file-autoloads
Update the autoloads for FILE in `generated-autoload-file'
(which FILE might bind in its local variables).Fupdate-autoloads-from-directories
Update loaddefs.el with all the current autoloads from DIRS, and no old ones.
This uses `update-file-autoloads' (which see) do its work.Fbatch-update-autoloads
Update loaddefs.el autoloads in batch mode.
Calls `update-autoloads-from-directories' on the command line arguments.Vauto-revert-mode
*Non-nil when Auto-Revert Mode is active.

Never set this variable directly, use the command `auto-revert-mode'
instead.Vglobal-auto-revert-mode
When on, buffers are automatically reverted when files on disk change.

Set this variable using \[customize] only.  Otherwise, use the
command `global-auto-revert-mode'.Fauto-revert-mode
Toggle reverting buffer when file on disk changes.

With arg, turn Auto Revert mode on if and only if arg is positive.
This is a minor mode that affects only the current buffer.
Use `global-auto-revert-mode' to automatically revert all buffers.Fturn-on-auto-revert-mode
Turn on Auto-Revert Mode.

This function is designed to be added to hooks, for example:
  (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-revert-mode)Fglobal-auto-revert-mode
Revert any buffer when file on disk change.

With arg, turn Auto Revert mode on globally if and only if arg is positive.
This is a minor mode that affects all buffers.
Use `auto-revert-mode' to revert a particular buffer.Vmouse-avoidance-mode
Activate mouse avoidance mode.
See function `mouse-avoidance-mode' for possible values.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `mouse-avoidance-mode'.Fmouse-avoidance-mode
Set cursor avoidance mode to MODE.
MODE should be one of the symbols `banish', `exile', `jump', `animate',
`cat-and-mouse', `proteus', or `none'.

If MODE is nil, toggle mouse avoidance between `none' and `banish'
modes.  Positive numbers and symbols other than the above are treated
as equivalent to `banish'; negative numbers and `-' are equivalent to `none'.

Effects of the different modes:
 * banish: Move the mouse to the upper-right corner on any keypress.
 * exile: Move the mouse to the corner only if the cursor gets too close,
     and allow it to return once the cursor is out of the way.
 * jump: If the cursor gets too close to the mouse, displace the mouse
     a random distance & direction.
 * animate: As `jump', but shows steps along the way for illusion of motion.
 * cat-and-mouse: Same as `animate'.
 * proteus: As `animate', but changes the shape of the mouse pointer too.

Whenever the mouse is moved, the frame is also raised.

(see `mouse-avoidance-threshold' for definition of "too close",
and `mouse-avoidance-nudge-dist' and `mouse-avoidance-nudge-var' for
definition of "random distance".)Fawk-mode
Major mode for editing AWK code.
This is much like C mode except for the syntax of comments.  Its keymap
inherits from C mode's and it has the same variables for customizing
indentation.  It has its own abbrev table and its own syntax table.

Turning on AWK mode runs `awk-mode-hook'.Fbackquote
Argument STRUCTURE describes a template to build.

The whole structure acts as if it were quoted except for certain
places where expressions are evaluated and inserted or spliced in.

For example:

b              => (ba bb bc)		; assume b has this value
`(a b c)       => (a b c)		; backquote acts like quote
`(a ,b c)      => (a (ba bb bc) c)	; insert the value of b
`(a ,@b c)     => (a ba bb bc c)	; splice in the value of b

Vectors work just like lists.  Nested backquotes are permitted.Fbattery
Display battery status information in the echo area.
The text being displayed in the echo area is controlled by the variables
`battery-echo-area-format' and `battery-status-function'.Fdisplay-battery
Display battery status information in the mode line.
The text being displayed in the mode line is controlled by the variables
`battery-mode-line-format' and `battery-status-function'.
The mode line will be updated automatically every `battery-update-interval'
seconds.Fbibtex-mode
Major mode for editing BibTeX files.

To submit a problem report, enter \[bibtex-submit-bug-report] from a
BibTeX mode buffer.  This automatically sets up a mail buffer with
version information already added.  You just need to add a description
of the problem, including a reproducable test case and send the
message.


General information on working with BibTeX mode:

You should use commands as \[bibtex-Book] to get a template for a
specific entry. You should then fill in all desired fields using
\[bibtex-next-field] to jump from field to field. After having filled
in all desired fields in the entry, you should clean the new entry
with command \[bibtex-clean-entry].

Some features of BibTeX mode are available only by setting variable
bibtex-maintain-sorted-entries to t. However, then BibTeX mode will
work with buffer containing only valid (syntactical correct) entries
and with entries being sorted. This is usually the case, if you have
created a buffer completely with BibTeX mode and finished every new
entry with \[bibtex-clean-entry].

For third party BibTeX buffers, please call the function
`bibtex-convert-alien' to fully take advantage of all features of
BibTeX mode.


Special information:

A command such as \[bibtex-Book] will outline the fields for a BibTeX book entry.

The optional fields start with the string OPT, and are thus ignored by BibTeX.
Alternatives from which only one is required start with the string ALT.
The OPT or ALT string may be removed from a field with \[bibtex-remove-OPT-or-ALT].
\[bibtex-make-field] inserts a new field after the current one.
\[bibtex-kill-field] kills the current field entirely.
\[bibtex-yank] will yank the last recently killed field after the
current field.
\[bibtex-remove-delimiters] removes the double-quotes or braces around the text of the current field.
 \[bibtex-empty-field] replaces the text of the current field with the default "" or {}.

The command \[bibtex-clean-entry] cleans the current entry, i.e. it removes OPT/ALT
from all non-empty optional or alternative fields, checks that no required
fields are empty, and does some formatting dependent on the value of
bibtex-entry-format.
Note: some functions in BibTeX mode depend on entries being in a special
format (all fields beginning on separate lines), so it is usually a bad
idea to remove `realign' from bibtex-entry-format.

Use \[bibtex-find-text] to position the cursor at the end of the current field.
Use \[bibtex-next-field] to move to end of the next field.

\{bibtex-mode-map}Fblackbox
Play blackbox.  Optional prefix argument is the number of balls;
the default is 4.

What is blackbox?

Blackbox is a game of hide and seek played on an 8 by 8 grid (the
Blackbox).  Your opponent (Emacs, in this case) has hidden several
balls (usually 4) within this box.  By shooting rays into the box and
observing where they emerge it is possible to deduce the positions of
the hidden balls.  The fewer rays you use to find the balls, the lower
your score.

Overview of play:

\<blackbox-mode-map>To play blackbox, type \[blackbox].  An optional prefix argument
specifies the number of balls to be hidden in the box; the default is
four.

The cursor can be moved around the box with the standard cursor
movement keys.

To shoot a ray, move the cursor to the edge of the box and press SPC.
The result will be determined and the playfield updated.

You may place or remove balls in the box by moving the cursor into the
box and pressing \[bb-romp].

When you think the configuration of balls you have placed is correct,
press \[bb-done].  You will be informed whether you are correct or
not, and be given your score.  Your score is the number of letters and
numbers around the outside of the box plus five for each incorrectly
placed ball.  If you placed any balls incorrectly, they will be
indicated with `x', and their actual positions indicated with `o'.

Details:

There are three possible outcomes for each ray you send into the box:

	Detour: the ray is deflected and emerges somewhere other than
		where you sent it in.  On the playfield, detours are
		denoted by matching pairs of numbers -- one where the
		ray went in, and the other where it came out.

	Reflection: the ray is reflected and emerges in the same place
		it was sent in.  On the playfield, reflections are
		denoted by the letter `R'.

	Hit:	the ray strikes a ball directly and is absorbed.  It does
		not emerge from the box.  On the playfield, hits are
		denoted by the letter `H'.

The rules for how balls deflect rays are simple and are best shown by
example.

As a ray approaches a ball it is deflected ninety degrees.  Rays can
be deflected multiple times.  In the diagrams below, the dashes
represent empty box locations and the letter `O' represents a ball.
The entrance and exit points of each ray are marked with numbers as
described under "Detour" above.  Note that the entrance and exit
points are always interchangeable.  `*' denotes the path taken by the
ray.

Note carefully the relative positions of the ball and the ninety
degree deflection it causes.

As mentioned above, a reflection occurs when a ray emerges from the same point
it was sent in.  This can happen in several ways:

                                                                           
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - O - - -         - - O - O - - -          - - - - - - - -
R * * * * - - - -         - - - * - - - -          O - - - - - - -
  - - - - O - - -         - - - * - - - -        R - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - * - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - * - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -       R * * * * - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -          - - - - - - - -

In the first example, the ray is deflected downwards by the upper
ball, then left by the lower ball, and finally retraces its path to
its point of origin.  The second example is similar.  The third
example is a bit anomalous but can be rationalized by realizing the
ray never gets a chance to get into the box.  Alternatively, the ray
can be thought of as being deflected downwards and immediately
emerging from the box.

A hit occurs when a ray runs straight into a ball:

  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - O - - -

  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -

Be sure to compare the second example of a hit with the first example of
a reflection.Vbookmark-map
Keymap containing bindings to bookmark functions.
It is not bound to any key by default: to bind it
so that you have a bookmark prefix, just use `global-set-key' and bind a
key of your choice to `bookmark-map'.  All interactive bookmark
functions have a binding in this keymap.Fbookmark-set
Set a bookmark named NAME inside a file.
If name is nil, then the user will be prompted.
With prefix arg, will not overwrite a bookmark that has the same name
as NAME if such a bookmark already exists, but instead will "push"
the new bookmark onto the bookmark alist.  Thus the most recently set
bookmark with name NAME would be the one in effect at any given time,
but the others are still there, should you decide to delete the most
recent one.

To yank words from the text of the buffer and use them as part of the
bookmark name, type C-w while setting a bookmark.  Successive C-w's
yank successive words.

Typing C-u inserts the name of the last bookmark used in the buffer
(as an aid in using a single bookmark name to track your progress
through a large file).  If no bookmark was used, then C-u inserts the
name of the file being visited.

Use \[bookmark-delete] to remove bookmarks (you give it a name,
and it removes only the first instance of a bookmark with that name from
the list of bookmarks.)Fbookmark-jump
Jump to bookmark BOOKMARK (a point in some file).
You may have a problem using this function if the value of variable
`bookmark-alist' is nil.  If that happens, you need to load in some
bookmarks.  See help on function `bookmark-load' for more about
this.

If the file pointed to by BOOKMARK no longer exists, you will be asked
if you wish to give the bookmark a new location, and bookmark-jump
will then jump to the new location, as well as recording it in place
of the old one in the permanent bookmark record.Fbookmark-relocate
Relocate BOOKMARK to another file (reading file name with minibuffer).
This makes an already existing bookmark point to that file, instead of
the one it used to point at.  Useful when a file has been renamed
after a bookmark was set in it.Fbookmark-insert-location
Insert the name of the file associated with BOOKMARK.
Optional second arg NO-HISTORY means don't record this in the
minibuffer history list `bookmark-history'.Fbookmark-rename
Change the name of OLD bookmark to NEW name.
If called from keyboard, prompt for OLD and NEW.  If called from
menubar, select OLD from a menu and prompt for NEW.

If called from Lisp, prompt for NEW if only OLD was passed as an
argument.  If called with two strings, then no prompting is done.  You
must pass at least OLD when calling from Lisp.

While you are entering the new name, consecutive C-w's insert
consecutive words from the text of the buffer into the new bookmark
name.Fbookmark-insert
Insert the text of the file pointed to by bookmark BOOKMARK.
You may have a problem using this function if the value of variable
`bookmark-alist' is nil.  If that happens, you need to load in some
bookmarks.  See help on function `bookmark-load' for more about
this.Fbookmark-delete
Delete BOOKMARK from the bookmark list.
Removes only the first instance of a bookmark with that name.  If
there are one or more other bookmarks with the same name, they will
not be deleted.  Defaults to the "current" bookmark (that is, the
one most recently used in this file, if any).
Optional second arg BATCH means don't update the bookmark list buffer,
probably because we were called from there.Fbookmark-write
Write bookmarks to a file (reading the file name with the minibuffer).
Don't use this in Lisp programs; use `bookmark-save' instead.Fbookmark-save
Save currently defined bookmarks.
Saves by default in the file defined by the variable
`bookmark-default-file'.  With a prefix arg, save it in file FILE
(second argument).

If you are calling this from Lisp, the two arguments are PREFIX-ARG
and FILE, and if you just want it to write to the default file, then
pass no arguments.  Or pass in nil and FILE, and it will save in FILE
instead.  If you pass in one argument, and it is non-nil, then the
user will be interactively queried for a file to save in.

When you want to load in the bookmarks from a file, use
`bookmark-load', \[bookmark-load].  That function will prompt you
for a file, defaulting to the file defined by variable
`bookmark-default-file'.Fbookmark-load
Load bookmarks from FILE (which must be in bookmark format).
Appends loaded bookmarks to the front of the list of bookmarks.  If
optional second argument OVERWRITE is non-nil, existing bookmarks are
destroyed.  Optional third arg NO-MSG means don't display any messages
while loading.

If you load a file that doesn't contain a proper bookmark alist, you
will corrupt Emacs's bookmark list.  Generally, you should only load
in files that were created with the bookmark functions in the first
place.  Your own personal bookmark file, `~/.emacs.bmk', is
maintained automatically by Emacs; you shouldn't need to load it
explicitly.

If you load a file containing bookmarks with the same names as
bookmarks already present in your Emacs, the new bookmarks will get
unique numeric suffixes "<2>", "<3>", ... following the same
method buffers use to resolve name collisions.Fbookmark-bmenu-list
Display a list of existing bookmarks.
The list is displayed in a buffer named `*Bookmark List*'.
The leftmost column displays a D if the bookmark is flagged for
deletion, or > if it is flagged for displaying.Fbookmark-menu-insert
Insert the text of the file pointed to by bookmark BOOKMARK.
You may have a problem using this function if the value of variable
`bookmark-alist' is nil.  If that happens, you need to load in some
bookmarks.  See help on function `bookmark-load' for more about
this.

Warning: this function only takes an EVENT as argument.  Use the
corresponding bookmark function from Lisp (the one without the
"-menu-" in its name).Fbookmark-menu-jump
Jump to bookmark BOOKMARK (a point in some file).
You may have a problem using this function if the value of variable
`bookmark-alist' is nil.  If that happens, you need to load in some
bookmarks.  See help on function `bookmark-load' for more about
this.

Warning: this function only takes an EVENT as argument.  Use the
corresponding bookmark function from Lisp (the one without the
"-menu-" in its name).Fbookmark-menu-locate
Insert the name of the file associated with BOOKMARK.
(This is not the same as the contents of that file).

Warning: this function only takes an EVENT as argument.  Use the
corresponding bookmark function from Lisp (the one without the
"-menu-" in its name).Fbookmark-menu-rename
Change the name of OLD-BOOKMARK to NEWNAME.
If called from keyboard, prompts for OLD-BOOKMARK and NEWNAME.
If called from menubar, OLD-BOOKMARK is selected from a menu, and
prompts for NEWNAME.
If called from Lisp, prompts for NEWNAME if only OLD-BOOKMARK was
passed as an argument.  If called with two strings, then no prompting
is done.  You must pass at least OLD-BOOKMARK when calling from Lisp.

While you are entering the new name, consecutive C-w's insert
consecutive words from the text of the buffer into the new bookmark
name.

Warning: this function only takes an EVENT as argument.  Use the
corresponding bookmark function from Lisp (the one without the
"-menu-" in its name).Fbookmark-menu-delete
Delete the bookmark named NAME from the bookmark list.
Removes only the first instance of a bookmark with that name.  If
there are one or more other bookmarks with the same name, they will
not be deleted.  Defaults to the "current" bookmark (that is, the
one most recently used in this file, if any).

Warning: this function only takes an EVENT as argument.  Use the
corresponding bookmark function from Lisp (the one without the
"-menu-" in its name).Vbrowse-url-browser-function
*Function to display the current buffer in a WWW browser.
This is used by the `browse-url-at-point', `browse-url-at-mouse', and
`browse-url-of-file' commands.

If the value is not a function it should be a list of pairs
(REGEXP . FUNCTION).  In this case the function called will be the one
associated with the first REGEXP which matches the current URL.  The
function is passed the URL and any other args of `browse-url'.  The last
regexp should probably be "." to specify a default browser.Vbrowse-url-new-window-flag
*If non-nil, always open a new browser window with appropriate browsers.
Passing an interactive argument to \[browse-url], or specific browser
commands reverses the effect of this variable.  Requires Netscape version

User can move with [up] or [down], select a buffer
by \[bs-select] or [SPC]

Type \[bs-kill] to leave Buffer Selection Menu without a selection.
Type \[bs-help] after invocation to get help on commands available.
With prefix argument ARG show a different buffer list.  Function
`bs--configuration-name-for-prefix-arg' determine accordingly
name of buffer configuration.Fbyte-force-recompile
Recompile every `.el' file in DIRECTORY that already has a `.elc' file.
Files in subdirectories of DIRECTORY are processed also.Fbyte-recompile-directory
Recompile every `.el' file in DIRECTORY that needs recompilation.
This is if a `.elc' file exists but is older than the `.el' file.
Files in subdirectories of DIRECTORY are processed also.

If the `.elc' file does not exist, normally the `.el' file is *not* compiled.
But a prefix argument (optional second arg) means ask user,
for each such `.el' file, whether to compile it.  Prefix argument 0 means
don't ask and compile the file anyway.

A nonzero prefix argument also means ask about each subdirectory.

If the third argument FORCE is non-nil,
recompile every `.el' file that already has a `.elc' file.Fbyte-compile-file
Compile a file of Lisp code named FILENAME into a file of byte code.
The output file's name is made by appending `c' to the end of FILENAME.

If FORM is a lambda or a macro, byte-compile it as a function.Fdisplay-call-tree
Display a call graph of a specified file.
This lists which functions have been called, what functions called
them, and what functions they call.  The list includes all functions
whose definitions have been compiled in this Emacs session, as well as
all functions called by those functions.

The call graph does not include macros, inline functions, or
primitives that the byte-code interpreter knows about directly (eq,
cons, etc.).

The call tree also lists those functions which are not known to be called
(that is, to which no calls have been compiled), and which cannot be
invoked interactively.Fbatch-byte-compile
Run `byte-compile-file' on the files remaining on the command line.
Use this from the command line, with `-batch';
it won't work in an interactive Emacs.
Each file is processed even if an error occurred previously.
For example, invoke "emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile $emacs/ ~/*.el"Fbatch-byte-recompile-directory
Runs `byte-recompile-directory' on the dirs remaining on the command line.
Must be used only with `-batch', and kills Emacs on completion.

See the documentation for `calculator-mode' for more information.Vcalendar-week-start-day
*The day of the week on which a week in the calendar begins.
0 means Sunday (default), 1 means Monday, and so on.Vcalendar-offset
*The offset of the principal month from the center of the calendar window.
0 means the principal month is in the center (default), -1 means on the left,
+1 means on the right.  Larger (or smaller) values push the principal month off
the screen.Vview-diary-entries-initially
*Non-nil means display current date's diary entries on entry.
The diary is displayed in another window when the calendar is first displayed,
if the current date is visible.  The number of days of diary entries displayed
is governed by the variable `number-of-diary-entries'.Vnumber-of-diary-entries
*Specifies how many days of diary entries are to be displayed initially.
This variable affects the diary display when the command \[diary] is used,
or if the value of the variable `view-diary-entries-initially' is t.  For
example, if the default value 1 is used, then only the current day's diary
entries will be displayed.  If the value 2 is used, then both the current
day's and the next day's entries will be displayed.

The value can also be a vector such as [0 2 2 2 2 4 1]; this value
says to display no diary entries on Sunday, the display the entries
for the current date and the day after on Monday through Thursday,
display Friday through Monday's entries on Friday, and display only
Saturday's entries on Saturday.

This variable does not affect the diary display with the `d' command
from the calendar; in that case, the prefix argument controls the
number of days of diary entries displayed.Vmark-diary-entries-in-calendar
*Non-nil means mark dates with diary entries, in the calendar window.
The marking symbol is specified by the variable `diary-entry-marker'.Vcalendar-remove-frame-by-deleting
*Determine how the calendar mode removes a frame no longer needed.
If nil, make an icon of the frame.  If non-nil, delete the frame.Vview-calendar-holidays-initially
*Non-nil means display holidays for current three month period on entry.
The holidays are displayed in another window when the calendar is first
displayed.Vmark-holidays-in-calendar
*Non-nil means mark dates of holidays in the calendar window.
The marking symbol is specified by the variable `calendar-holiday-marker'.Vall-hebrew-calendar-holidays
*If nil, show only major holidays from the Hebrew calendar.
This means only those Jewish holidays that appear on secular calendars.

If t, show all the holidays that would appear in a complete Hebrew calendar.Vall-christian-calendar-holidays
*If nil, show only major holidays from the Christian calendar.
This means only those Christian holidays that appear on secular calendars.

If t, show all the holidays that would appear in a complete Christian
calendar.Vall-islamic-calendar-holidays
*If nil, show only major holidays from the Islamic calendar.
This means only those Islamic holidays that appear on secular calendars.

If t, show all the holidays that would appear in a complete Islamic
calendar.Vcalendar-load-hook
*List of functions to be called after the calendar is first loaded.
This is the place to add key bindings to `calendar-mode-map'.Vinitial-calendar-window-hook
*List of functions to be called when the calendar window is first opened.
The functions invoked are called after the calendar window is opened, but
once opened is never called again.  Leaving the calendar with the `q' command
and reentering it will cause these functions to be called again.Vtoday-visible-calendar-hook
*List of functions called whenever the current date is visible.
This can be used, for example, to replace today's date with asterisks; a
function `calendar-star-date' is included for this purpose:
    (setq today-visible-calendar-hook 'calendar-star-date)
It can also be used to mark the current date with `calendar-today-marker';
a function is also provided for this:
    (setq today-visible-calendar-hook 'calendar-mark-today)

The corresponding variable `today-invisible-calendar-hook' is the list of
functions called when the calendar function was called when the current
date is not visible in the window.

Other than the use of the provided functions, the changing of any
characters in the calendar buffer by the hooks may cause the failure of the
functions that move by days and weeks.Vtoday-invisible-calendar-hook
*List of functions called whenever the current date is not visible.

The corresponding variable `today-visible-calendar-hook' is the list of
functions called when the calendar function was called when the current
date is visible in the window.

Other than the use of the provided functions, the changing of any
characters in the calendar buffer by the hooks may cause the failure of the
functions that move by days and weeks.Vcalendar-move-hook
*List of functions called whenever the cursor moves in the calendar.

For example,

  (add-hook 'calendar-move-hook (lambda () (view-diary-entries 1)))

redisplays the diary for whatever date the cursor is moved to.Vdiary-file
*Name of the file in which one's personal diary of dates is kept.

The file's entries are lines in any of the forms

            MONTH/DAY
            MONTH/DAY/YEAR
            MONTHNAME DAY
            MONTHNAME DAY, YEAR
            DAYNAME

at the beginning of the line; the remainder of the line is the diary entry
string for that date.  MONTH and DAY are one or two digit numbers, YEAR is
a number and may be written in full or abbreviated to the final two digits.
If the date does not contain a year, it is generic and applies to any year.
DAYNAME entries apply to any date on which is on that day of the week.
MONTHNAME and DAYNAME can be spelled in full, abbreviated to three
characters (with or without a period), capitalized or not.  Any of DAY,
MONTH, or MONTHNAME, YEAR can be `*' which matches any day, month, or year,
respectively.

The European style (in which the day precedes the month) can be used
instead, if you execute `european-calendar' when in the calendar, or set
`european-calendar-style' to t in your .emacs file.  The European forms are

            DAY/MONTH
            DAY/MONTH/YEAR
            DAY MONTHNAME
            DAY MONTHNAME YEAR
            DAYNAME

To revert to the default American style from the European style, execute
`american-calendar' in the calendar.

A diary entry can be preceded by the character
`diary-nonmarking-symbol' (ordinarily `&') to make that entry
nonmarking--that is, it will not be marked on dates in the calendar
window but will appear in a diary window.

Multiline diary entries are made by indenting lines after the first with
either a TAB or one or more spaces.

Lines not in one the above formats are ignored.  Here are some sample diary
entries (in the default American style):

     12/22/1988 Twentieth wedding anniversary!!
     &1/1. Happy New Year!
     10/22 Ruth's birthday.
     21: Payday
     Tuesday--weekly meeting with grad students at 10am
              Supowit, Shen, Bitner, and Kapoor to attend.
     1/13/89 Friday the thirteenth!!
     &thu 4pm squash game with Lloyd.
     mar 16 Dad's birthday
     April 15, 1989 Income tax due.
     &* 15 time cards due.

If the first line of a diary entry consists only of the date or day name with
no trailing blanks or punctuation, then that line is not displayed in the
diary window; only the continuation lines is shown.  For example, the
single diary entry

     02/11/1989
      Bill Blattner visits Princeton today
      2pm Cognitive Studies Committee meeting
      2:30-5:30 Lizzie at Lawrenceville for `Group Initiative'
      4:00pm Jamie Tappenden
      7:30pm Dinner at George and Ed's for Alan Ryan
      7:30-10:00pm dance at Stewart Country Day School

will appear in the diary window without the date line at the beginning.  This
facility allows the diary window to look neater, but can cause confusion if
used with more than one day's entries displayed.

Diary entries can be based on Lisp sexps.  For example, the diary entry

      %%(diary-block 11 1 1990 11 10 1990) Vacation

causes the diary entry "Vacation" to appear from November 1 through November
10, 1990.  Other functions available are `diary-float', `diary-anniversary',
`diary-cyclic', `diary-day-of-year', `diary-iso-date', `diary-french-date',
`diary-hebrew-date', `diary-islamic-date', `diary-mayan-date',
`diary-chinese-date', `diary-coptic-date', `diary-ethiopic-date',
`diary-persian-date', `diary-yahrzeit', `diary-sunrise-sunset',
`diary-phases-of-moon', `diary-parasha', `diary-omer', `diary-rosh-hodesh',
and `diary-sabbath-candles'.  See the documentation for the function
`list-sexp-diary-entries' for more details.

Diary entries based on the Hebrew and/or the Islamic calendar are also
possible, but because these are somewhat slow, they are ignored
unless you set the `nongregorian-diary-listing-hook' and the
`nongregorian-diary-marking-hook' appropriately.  See the documentation
for these functions for details.

Diary files can contain directives to include the contents of other files; for
details, see the documentation for the variable `list-diary-entries-hook'.Vdiary-nonmarking-symbol
*Symbol indicating that a diary entry is not to be marked in the calendar.Vhebrew-diary-entry-symbol
*Symbol indicating a diary entry according to the Hebrew calendar.Vislamic-diary-entry-symbol
*Symbol indicating a diary entry according to the Islamic calendar.Vdiary-include-string
*The string indicating inclusion of another file of diary entries.
See the documentation for the function `include-other-diary-files'.Vsexp-diary-entry-symbol
*The string used to indicate a sexp diary entry in `diary-file'.
See the documentation for the function `list-sexp-diary-entries'.Vabbreviated-calendar-year
*Interpret a two-digit year DD in a diary entry as either 19DD or 20DD.
For the Gregorian calendar; similarly for the Hebrew and Islamic calendars.
If this variable is nil, years must be written in full.Veuropean-calendar-style
*Use the European style of dates in the diary and in any displays.
If this variable is t, a date 1/2/1990 would be interpreted as February 1,
1990.  The accepted European date styles are

            DAY/MONTH
            DAY/MONTH/YEAR
            DAY MONTHNAME
            DAY MONTHNAME YEAR
            DAYNAME

Names can be capitalized or not, written in full, or abbreviated to three
characters with or without a period.Vamerican-date-diary-pattern
*List of pseudo-patterns describing the American patterns of date used.
See the documentation of `diary-date-forms' for an explanation.Veuropean-date-diary-pattern
*List of pseudo-patterns describing the European patterns of date used.
See the documentation of `diary-date-forms' for an explanation.Veuropean-calendar-display-form
*Pseudo-pattern governing the way a date appears in the European style.
See the documentation of calendar-date-display-form for an explanation.Vamerican-calendar-display-form
*Pseudo-pattern governing the way a date appears in the American style.
See the documentation of `calendar-date-display-form' for an explanation.Vprint-diary-entries-hook
*List of functions called after a temporary diary buffer is prepared.
The buffer shows only the diary entries currently visible in the diary
buffer.  The default just does the printing.  Other uses might include, for
example, rearranging the lines into order by day and time, saving the buffer
instead of deleting it, or changing the function used to do the printing.Vlist-diary-entries-hook
*List of functions called after diary file is culled for relevant entries.
It is to be used for diary entries that are not found in the diary file.

A function `include-other-diary-files' is provided for use as the value of
this hook.  This function enables you to use shared diary files together
with your own.  The files included are specified in the diary file by lines
of the form

        #include "filename"

This is recursive; that is, #include directives in files thus included are
obeyed.  You can change the "#include" to some other string by changing
the variable `diary-include-string'.  When you use `include-other-diary-files'
as part of the list-diary-entries-hook, you will probably also want to use the
function `mark-included-diary-files' as part of `mark-diary-entries-hook'.

For example, you could use

     (setq list-diary-entries-hook
       '(include-other-diary-files sort-diary-entries))
     (setq diary-display-hook 'fancy-diary-display)

in your `.emacs' file to cause the fancy diary buffer to be displayed with
diary entries from various included files, each day's entries sorted into
lexicographic order.Vdiary-hook
*List of functions called after the display of the diary.
Can be used for appointment notification.Vdiary-display-hook
*List of functions that handle the display of the diary.
If nil (the default), `simple-diary-display' is used.  Use `ignore' for no
diary display.

Ordinarily, this just displays the diary buffer (with holidays indicated in
the mode line), if there are any relevant entries.  At the time these
functions are called, the variable `diary-entries-list' is a list, in order
by date, of all relevant diary entries in the form of ((MONTH DAY YEAR)
STRING), where string is the diary entry for the given date.  This can be
used, for example, a different buffer for display (perhaps combined with
holidays), or produce hard copy output.

A function `fancy-diary-display' is provided as an alternative
choice for this hook; this function prepares a special noneditable diary
buffer with the relevant diary entries that has neat day-by-day arrangement
with headings.  The fancy diary buffer will show the holidays unless the
variable `holidays-in-diary-buffer' is set to nil.  Ordinarily, the fancy
diary buffer will not show days for which there are no diary entries, even
if that day is a holiday; if you want such days to be shown in the fancy
diary buffer, set the variable `diary-list-include-blanks' to t.Vnongregorian-diary-listing-hook
*List of functions called for listing diary file and included files.
As the files are processed for diary entries, these functions are used to cull
relevant entries.  You can use either or both of `list-hebrew-diary-entries'
and `list-islamic-diary-entries'.  The documentation for these functions
describes the style of such diary entries.Vmark-diary-entries-hook
*List of functions called after marking diary entries in the calendar.

A function `mark-included-diary-files' is also provided for use as the
`mark-diary-entries-hook'; it enables you to use shared diary files together
with your own.  The files included are specified in the diary file by lines
of the form
        #include "filename"
This is recursive; that is, #include directives in files thus included are
obeyed.  You can change the "#include" to some other string by changing the
variable `diary-include-string'.  When you use `mark-included-diary-files' as
part of the mark-diary-entries-hook, you will probably also want to use the
function `include-other-diary-files' as part of `list-diary-entries-hook'.Vnongregorian-diary-marking-hook
*List of functions called for marking diary file and included files.
As the files are processed for diary entries, these functions are used to cull
relevant entries.  You can use either or both of `mark-hebrew-diary-entries'
and `mark-islamic-diary-entries'.  The documentation for these functions
describes the style of such diary entries.Vdiary-list-include-blanks
*If nil, do not include days with no diary entry in the list of diary entries.
Such days will then not be shown in the fancy diary buffer, even if they
are holidays.Vholidays-in-diary-buffer
*Non-nil means include holidays in the diary display.
The holidays appear in the mode line of the diary buffer, or in the
fancy diary buffer next to the date.  This slows down the diary functions
somewhat; setting it to nil makes the diary display faster.Vgeneral-holidays
*General holidays.  Default value is for the United States.
See the documentation for `calendar-holidays' for details.Voriental-holidays
*Oriental holidays.
See the documentation for `calendar-holidays' for details.Vlocal-holidays

*Sun-related holidays.
See the documentation for `calendar-holidays' for details.Vcalendar-setup
The frame set up of the calendar.
The choices are `one-frame' (calendar and diary together in one separate,
dedicated frame), `two-frames' (calendar and diary in separate, dedicated
frames), `calendar-only' (calendar in a separate, dedicated frame); with
any other value the current frame is used.Fcalendar
Choose between the one frame, two frame, or basic calendar displays.
The original function `calendar' has been renamed `calendar-basic-setup'.Vc-mode-syntax-table

Major mode for editing K&R and ANSI C code.
To submit a problem report, enter `\[c-submit-bug-report]' from a
c-mode buffer.  This automatically sets up a mail buffer with version
information already added.  You just need to add a description of the
problem, including a reproducible test case and send the message.

To see what version of CC Mode you are running, enter `\[c-version]'.

The hook variable `c-mode-hook' is run with no args, if that value is
bound and has a non-nil value.  Also the hook `c-mode-common-hook' is
run first.

Key bindings:
\{c-mode-map}Fc++-mode

`c-mode-common-hook' is run first.

Key bindings:
\{pike-mode-map}Fc-set-style
Set CC Mode variables to use one of several different indentation styles.
STYLENAME is a string representing the desired style from the list of
styles described in the variable `c-style-alist'.  See that variable
for details of setting up styles.

The variable `c-indentation-style' always contains the buffer's current
style name.

If the optional argument DONT-OVERRIDE is non-nil, no style variables
that already have values will be overridden.  I.e. in the case of
`c-offsets-alist', syntactic symbols will only be added, and in the
case of all other style variables, only those set to `set-from-style'
will be reassigned.

Obviously, specifying DONT-OVERRIDE is useful mainly when the initial
style is chosen for a CC Mode buffer by a major mode.  Since this is
done internally by CC Mode, there's hardly ever a reason to use it.Fc-add-style
Adds a style to `c-style-alist', or updates an existing one.
STYLE is a string identifying the style to add or update.  DESCRIP is
an association list describing the style and must be of the form:

  ([BASESTYLE] (VARIABLE . VALUE) [(VARIABLE . VALUE) ...])

See the variable `c-style-alist' for the semantics of BASESTYLE,
VARIABLE and VALUE.  This function also sets the current style to
STYLE using `c-set-style' if the optional SET-P flag is non-nil.Fc-set-offset
Change the value of a syntactic element symbol in `c-offsets-alist'.
SYMBOL is the syntactic element symbol to change and OFFSET is the new
offset for that syntactic element.  The optional argument is not used
and exists only for compatibility reasons.Vc-emacs-features
A list of features extant in the Emacs you are using.
There are many flavors of Emacs out there, each with different
features supporting those needed by CC Mode.  Here's the current
supported list, along with the values for this variable:

 XEmacs 19, 20, 21:          (8-bit)
 Emacs 19, 20:               (1-bit)

Infodock (based on XEmacs) has an additional symbol on this list:
`infodock'.Fccl-compile
Return the compiled code of CCL-PROGRAM as a vector of integers.Fccl-dump
Disassemble compiled CCL-CODE.Fdeclare-ccl-program
Declare NAME as a name of CCL program.

This macro exists for backward compatibility.  In the old version of
Emacs, to compile a CCL program which calls another CCL program not
yet defined, it must be declared as a CCL program in advance.  But,
now CCL program names are resolved not at compile time but before
execution.

Optional arg VECTOR is a compiled CCL code of the CCL program.Fdefine-ccl-program
Set NAME the compiled code of CCL-PROGRAM.

CCL-PROGRAM has this form:
	(BUFFER_MAGNIFICATION
	 CCL_MAIN_CODE
	 [ CCL_EOF_CODE ])

BUFFER_MAGNIFICATION is an integer value specifying the approximate
output buffer magnification size compared with the bytes of input data
text.  If the value is zero, the CCL program can't execute `read' and
`write' commands.

CCL_MAIN_CODE and CCL_EOF_CODE are CCL program codes.  CCL_MAIN_CODE
executed at first.  If there's no more input data when `read' command
is executed in CCL_MAIN_CODE, CCL_EOF_CODE is executed.  If
CCL_MAIN_CODE is terminated, CCL_EOF_CODE is not executed.

Here's the syntax of CCL program code in BNF notation.  The lines
starting by two semicolons (and optional leading spaces) describe the
semantics.

Fcheck-ccl-program
Check validity of CCL-PROGRAM.
If CCL-PROGRAM is a symbol denoting a CCL program, return
CCL-PROGRAM, else return nil.
If CCL-PROGRAM is a vector and optional arg NAME (symbol) is supplied,
register CCL-PROGRAM by name NAME, and return NAME.Fccl-execute-with-args
Execute CCL-PROGRAM with registers initialized by the remaining args.
The return value is a vector of resulting CCL registers.

See the documentation of `define-ccl-program' for the detail of CCL program.Fcheckdoc
Interactivly check the entire buffer for style errors.
The current status of the ckeck will be displayed in a buffer which
the users will view as each check is completed.Fcheckdoc-interactive
Interactively check the current buffer for doc string errors.
Prefix argument START-HERE will start the checking from the current
point, otherwise the check starts at the beginning of the current
buffer.  Allows navigation forward and backwards through document
errors.  Does not check for comment or space warnings.
Optional argument SHOWSTATUS indicates that we should update the
checkdoc status window instead of the usual behavior.Fcheckdoc-message-interactive
Interactively check the current buffer for message string errors.
Prefix argument START-HERE will start the checking from the current
point, otherwise the check starts at the beginning of the current
buffer.  Allows navigation forward and backwards through document
errors.  Does not check for comment or space warnings.
Optional argument SHOWSTATUS indicates that we should update the
checkdoc status window instead of the usual behavior.Fcheckdoc-eval-current-buffer
Evaluate and check documentation for the current buffer.
Evaluation is done first because good documentation for something that
doesn't work is just not useful.  Comments, doc strings, and rogue
spacing are all verified.Fcheckdoc-current-buffer
Check current buffer for document, comment, error style, and rogue spaces.
With a prefix argument (in Lisp, the argument TAKE-NOTES),
store all errors found in a warnings buffer,
otherwise stop after the first error.Fcheckdoc-start
Start scanning the current buffer for documentation string style errors.
Only documentation strings are checked.
Use `checkdoc-continue' to continue checking if an error cannot be fixed.
Prefix argument TAKE-NOTES means to collect all the warning messages into
a separate buffer.Fcheckdoc-continue
Find the next doc string in the current buffer which has a style error.
Prefix argument TAKE-NOTES means to continue through the whole buffer and
save warnings in a separate buffer.  Second optional argument START-POINT
is the starting location.  If this is nil, `point-min' is used instead.Fcheckdoc-comments
Find missing comment sections in the current Emacs Lisp file.
Prefix argument TAKE-NOTES non-nil means to save warnings in a
separate buffer.  Otherwise print a message.  This returns the error
if there is one.Fcheckdoc-rogue-spaces
Find extra spaces at the end of lines in the current file.
Prefix argument TAKE-NOTES non-nil means to save warnings in a
separate buffer.  Otherwise print a message.  This returns the error
if there is one.
Optional argument INTERACT permits more interactive fixing.Fcheckdoc-message-text
Scan the buffer for occurrences of the error function, and verify text.
Optional argument TAKE-NOTES causes all errors to be logged.Fcheckdoc-eval-defun
Evaluate the current form with `eval-defun' and check its documentation.
Evaluation is done first so the form will be read before the
documentation is checked.  If there is a documentation error, then the display
of what was evaluated will be overwritten by the diagnostic message.Fcheckdoc-defun
Examine the doc string of the function or variable under point.
Call `error' if the doc string has problems.  If NO-ERROR is
non-nil, then do not call error, but call `message' instead.
If the doc string passes the test, then check the function for rogue white
space at the end of each line.Fcheckdoc-ispell
Check the style and spelling of everything interactively.
Calls `checkdoc' with spell-checking turned on.
Prefix argument TAKE-NOTES is the same as for `checkdoc'Fcheckdoc-ispell-current-buffer

Calls `checkdoc-continue' with spell-checking turned on.
Prefix argument TAKE-NOTES is the same as for `checkdoc-continue'Fcheckdoc-ispell-comments
Check the style and spelling of the current buffer's comments.
Calls `checkdoc-comments' with spell-checking turned on.
Prefix argument TAKE-NOTES is the same as for `checkdoc-comments'Fcheckdoc-ispell-defun
Check the style and spelling of the current defun with Ispell.
Calls `checkdoc-defun' with spell-checking turned on.
Prefix argument TAKE-NOTES is the same as for `checkdoc-defun'Fcheckdoc-minor-mode
Toggle Checkdoc minor mode, a mode for checking Lisp doc strings.
With prefix ARG, turn Checkdoc minor mode on iff ARG is positive.

In Checkdoc minor mode, the usual bindings for `eval-defun' which is
bound to \<checkdoc-minor-mode-map> \[checkdoc-eval-defun] and `checkdoc-eval-current-buffer' are overridden to include
checking of documentation strings.

\{checkdoc-minor-mode-map}Fdecode-hz-region
Decode HZ/ZW encoded text in the current region.
Return the length of resulting text.Fdecode-hz-buffer
Decode HZ/ZW encoded text in the current buffer.Fencode-hz-region
Encode the text in the current region to HZ.
Return the length of resulting text.Fencode-hz-buffer
Encode the text in the current buffer to HZ.Frepeat-matching-complex-command
Edit and re-evaluate complex command with name matching PATTERN.
Matching occurrences are displayed, most recent first, until you select
a form for evaluation.  If PATTERN is empty (or nil), every form in the
command history is offered.  The form is placed in the minibuffer for
editing and the result is evaluated.Flist-command-history
List history of commands typed to minibuffer.
The number of commands listed is controlled by `list-command-history-max'.
Calls value of `list-command-history-filter' (if non-nil) on each history
element to judge if that element should be excluded from the list.

The buffer is left in Command History mode.Fcommand-history
Examine commands from `command-history' in a buffer.
The number of commands listed is controlled by `list-command-history-max'.
The command history is filtered by `list-command-history-filter' if non-nil.
Use \<command-history-map>\[command-history-repeat] to repeat the command on the current line.

Otherwise much like Emacs-Lisp Mode except that there is no self-insertion
and digits provide prefix arguments.  Tab does not indent.
\{command-history-map}

This command always recompiles the Command History listing
and runs the normal hook `command-history-hook'.Vcustom-print-functions
This is a list of functions that format user objects for printing.
Each function is called in turn with three arguments: the object, the
stream, and the print level (currently ignored).  If it is able to
print the object it returns true; otherwise it returns nil and the
printer proceeds to the next function on the list.

This variable is not used at present, but it is defined in hopes that
a future Emacs interpreter will be able to use it.Fc-macro-expand
Expand C macros in the region, using the C preprocessor.
Normally display output in temp buffer, but
prefix arg means replace the region with it.

`c-macro-preprocessor' specifies the preprocessor to use.
Prompt for arguments to the preprocessor (e.g. `-DDEBUG -I ./include')
if the user option `c-macro-prompt-flag' is non-nil.

Noninteractive args are START, END, SUBST.
For use inside Lisp programs, see also `c-macro-expansion'.Frun-scheme
Run an inferior Scheme process, input and output via buffer *scheme*.
If there is a process already running in `*scheme*', switch to that buffer.
With argument, allows you to edit the command line (default is value
of `scheme-program-name').  Runs the hooks `inferior-scheme-mode-hook'
(after the `comint-mode-hook' is run).
(Type \[describe-mode] in the process buffer for a list of commands.)Fcp-make-coding-systems-for-codepage
Create a coding system to convert IBM CODEPAGE into charset ISO-NAME
whose first character is at offset OFFSET from the beginning of 8-bit
ASCII table.

The created coding system has the usual 3 subsidiary systems: for Unix-,
DOS- and Mac-style EOL conversion.  However, unlike built-in coding
systems, the Mac-style EOL conversion is currently not supported by the
decoder and encoder created by this function.Fcp-charset-for-codepage
Return the charset for which there is a translation table to DOS CODEPAGE.
CODEPAGE must be the name of a DOS codepage, a string.Fcp-language-for-codepage
Return the name of the MULE language environment for CODEPAGE.
CODEPAGE must be the name of a DOS codepage, a string.Fcp-offset-for-codepage
Return the offset to be used in setting up coding systems for CODEPAGE.
CODEPAGE must be the name of a DOS codepage, a string.Fcp-supported-codepages
Return an alist of supported codepages.

Each association in the alist has the form (NNN . CHARSET), where NNN is the
codepage number, and CHARSET is the MULE charset which is the closest match
for the character set supported by that codepage.

A codepage NNN is supported if a variable called `cpNNN-decode-table' exists,
is a vector, and has a charset property.Fcodepage-setup
Create a coding system cpCODEPAGE to support the IBM codepage CODEPAGE.

These coding systems are meant for encoding and decoding 8-bit non-ASCII
characters used by the IBM codepages, typically in conjunction with files
read/written by MS-DOS software, or for display on the MS-DOS terminal.Fmake-comint-in-buffer
Make a comint process NAME in BUFFER, running PROGRAM.
If BUFFER is nil, it defaults to NAME surrounded by `*'s.
PROGRAM should be either a string denoting an executable program to create
via `start-process', or a cons pair of the form (HOST . SERVICE) denoting a TCP
connection to be opened via `open-network-stream'.  If there is already a
running process in that buffer, it is not restarted.  Optional third arg
STARTFILE is the name of a file to send the contents of to the process.

If PROGRAM is a string, any more args are arguments to PROGRAM.Fmake-comint
Make a comint process NAME in a buffer, running PROGRAM.
The name of the buffer is made by surrounding NAME with `*'s.
PROGRAM should be either a string denoting an executable program to create
via `start-process', or a cons pair of the form (HOST . SERVICE) denoting a TCP
connection to be opened via `open-network-stream'.  If there is already a
running process in that buffer, it is not restarted.  Optional third arg
STARTFILE is the name of a file to send the contents of to the process.

If PROGRAM is a string, any more args are arguments to PROGRAM.Fcomint-run
Run PROGRAM in a comint buffer and switch to it.
The buffer name is made by surrounding the file name of PROGRAM with `*'s.
The file name is used to make a symbol name, such as `comint-sh-hook', and any
hooks on this symbol are run in the buffer.
See `make-comint' and `comint-exec'.Fcomint-redirect-send-command
Send COMMAND to process in current buffer, with output to OUTPUT-BUFFER.
With prefix arg, echo output in process buffer.

If NO-DISPLAY is non-nil, do not show the output buffer.Fcomint-redirect-send-command-to-process
Send COMMAND to PROCESS, with output to OUTPUT-BUFFER.
With prefix arg, echo output in process buffer.

If NO-DISPLAY is non-nil, do not show the output buffer.Fcomint-redirect-results-list
Send COMMAND to current process.
Return a list of expressions in the output which match REGEXP.
REGEXP-GROUP is the regular expression group in REGEXP to use.Fcomint-redirect-results-list-from-process
Send COMMAND to PROCESS.
Return a list of expressions in the output which match REGEXP.
REGEXP-GROUP is the regular expression group in REGEXP to use.Fcompare-windows
Compare text in current window with text in next window.
Compares the text starting at point in each window,
moving over text in each one as far as they match.

This command pushes the mark in each window
at the prior location of point in that window.
If both windows display the same buffer,
the mark is pushed twice in that buffer:
first in the other window, then in the selected window.

A prefix arg means ignore changes in whitespace.
The variable `compare-windows-whitespace' controls how whitespace is skipped.
If `compare-ignore-case' is non-nil, changes in case are also ignored.Vcompilation-mode-hook
*List of hook functions run by `compilation-mode' (see `run-hooks').Vcompilation-window-height
*Number of lines in a compilation window.  If nil, use Emacs default.Vcompilation-process-setup-function
*Function to call to customize the compilation process.
This functions is called immediately before the compilation process is
started.  It can be used to set any variables or functions that are used
while processing the output of the compilation process.Vcompilation-buffer-name-function
Function to compute the name of a compilation buffer.
The function receives one argument, the name of the major mode of the
compilation buffer.  It should return a string.
nil means compute the name with `(concat "*" (downcase major-mode) "*")'.Vcompilation-finish-function
Function to call when a compilation process finishes.
It is called with two arguments: the compilation buffer, and a string
describing how the process finished.Vcompilation-finish-functions
Functions to call when a compilation process finishes.
Each function is called with two arguments: the compilation buffer,
and a string describing how the process finished.Vcompilation-ask-about-save
*Non-nil means \[compile] asks which buffers to save before compiling.
Otherwise, it saves all modified buffers without asking.Vcompilation-search-path
*List of directories to search for source files named in error messages.
Elements should be directory names, not file names of directories.
nil as an element means to try the default directory.Fcompile
Compile the program including the current buffer.  Default: run `make'.
Runs COMMAND, a shell command, in a separate process asynchronously
with output going to the buffer `*compilation*'.

You can then use the command \[next-error] to find the next error message
and move to the source code that caused it.

Interactively, prompts for the command if `compilation-read-command' is
non-nil; otherwise uses `compile-command'.  With prefix arg, always prompts.

To run more than one compilation at once, start one and rename the
`*compilation*' buffer to some other name with \[rename-buffer].
Then start the next one.

The name used for the buffer is actually whatever is returned by
the function in `compilation-buffer-name-function', so you can set that
to a function that generates a unique name.Fgrep
Run grep, with user-specified args, and collect output in a buffer.
While grep runs asynchronously, you can use \[next-error] (M-x next-error),
or \<compilation-minor-mode-map>\[compile-goto-error] in the grep output buffer, to go to the lines
where grep found matches.

This command uses a special history list for its COMMAND-ARGS, so you can
easily repeat a grep command.

A prefix argument says to default the argument based upon the current
tag the cursor is over, substituting it into the last grep command
in the grep command history (or into `grep-command'
if that history list is empty).Fgrep-find
Run grep via find, with user-specified args COMMAND-ARGS.
Collect output in a buffer.
While find runs asynchronously, you can use the \[next-error] command
to find the text that grep hits refer to.

This command uses a special history list for its arguments, so you can
easily repeat a find command.Fcompilation-mode
Major mode for compilation log buffers.
\<compilation-mode-map>To visit the source for a line-numbered error,
move point to the error message line and type \[compile-goto-error].
To kill the compilation, type \[kill-compilation].

Runs `compilation-mode-hook' with `run-hooks' (which see).Fcompilation-shell-minor-mode
Toggle compilation shell minor mode.
With arg, turn compilation mode on if and only if arg is positive.
See `compilation-mode'.
Turning the mode on runs the normal hook `compilation-shell-minor-mode-hook'.Fcompilation-minor-mode
Toggle compilation minor mode.
With arg, turn compilation mode on if and only if arg is positive.
See `compilation-mode'.
Turning the mode on runs the normal hook `compilation-minor-mode-hook'.Fnext-error
Visit next compilation error message and corresponding source code.

If all the error messages parsed so far have been processed already,
the message buffer is checked for new ones.

A prefix ARGP specifies how many error messages to move;
negative means move back to previous error messages.
Just \[universal-argument] as a prefix means reparse the error message buffer
and start at the first error.

\[next-error] normally uses the most recently started compilation or
grep buffer.  However, it can operate on any buffer with output from
the \[compile] and \[grep] commands, or, more generally, on any
buffer in Compilation mode or with Compilation Minor mode enabled.  To
specify use of a particular buffer for error messages, type
\[next-error] in that buffer.

Once \[next-error] has chosen the buffer for error messages,
it stays with that buffer until you use it in some other buffer which
uses Compilation mode or Compilation Minor mode.

See variables `compilation-parse-errors-function' and
`compilation-error-regexp-alist' for customization ideas.Vpartial-completion-mode
Non-nil if Partial-Completion mode is enabled.
See the command `partial-completion-mode' for a description of this minor-mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `partial-completion-mode'.Fpartial-completion-mode
Toggle Partial Completion mode.
With prefix ARG, turn Partial Completion mode on if ARG is positive.

When Partial Completion mode is enabled, TAB (or M-TAB if `PC-meta-flag' is
nil) is enhanced so that if some string is divided into words and each word is
delimited by a character in `PC-word-delimiters', partial words are completed
as much as possible and `*' characters are treated likewise in file names.

For example, M-x p-c-m expands to M-x partial-completion-mode since no other
command begins with that sequence of characters, and
\[find-file] f_b.c TAB might complete to foo_bar.c if that file existed and no
other file in that directory begin with that sequence of characters.

Unless `PC-disable-includes' is non-nil, the `<...>' sequence is interpreted
specially in \[find-file].  For example,
\[find-file] <sys/time.h> RET finds the file `/usr/include/sys/time.h'.
See also the variable `PC-include-file-path'.Fdynamic-completion-mode
Enable dynamic word-completion.Vreference-point-alist
Alist of symbols vs integer codes of glyph reference points.
A glyph reference point symbol is to be used to specify a composition
rule in COMPONENTS argument to such functions as `compose-region' and
`make-composition'.

Meanings of glyph reference point codes are as follows:

    0----1----2 <---- ascent	0:tl or top-left
    |         |			1:tc or top-center
    |         |			2:tr or top-right
    |         |			3:Bl or base-left     9:cl or center-left
    9   10   11 <---- center	4:Bc or base-center  10:cc or center-center
    |         |			5:Br or base-right   11:cr or center-right
  --3----4----5-- <-- baseline	6:bl or bottom-left
    |         |			7:bc or bottom-center
    6----7----8 <---- descent	8:br or bottom-right

Glyph reference point symbols are to be used to specify composition
rule of the form (GLOBAL-REF-POINT . NEW-REF-POINT), where
GLOBAL-REF-POINT is a reference point in the overall glyphs already
composed, and NEW-REF-POINT is a reference point in the new glyph to
be added.

For instance, if GLOBAL-REF-POINT is `br' (bottom-right) and
NEW-REF-POINT is `tc' (top-center), the overall glyph is updated as
follows (the point `*' corresponds to both reference points):

    +-------+--+ <--- new ascent
    |       |  |
    | global|  |
    | glyph |  |
 -- |       |  |-- <--- baseline (doesn't change)
    +----+--*--+
    |    | new |
    |    |glyph|
    +----+-----+ <--- new descent
Fcompose-region
Compose characters in the current region.

When called from a program, expects these four arguments.

First two arguments START and END are positions (integers or markers)
specifying the region.

Optional 3rd argument COMPONENTS, if non-nil, is a character or a
sequence (vector, list, or string) of integers.

If it is a character, it is an alternate character to display instead
of the text in the region.

If it is a string, the elements are alternate characters.

If it is a vector or list, it is a sequence of alternate characters and
composition rules, where (2N)th elements are characters and (2N+1)th
elements are composition rules to specify how to compose (2N+2)th
elements with previously composed N glyphs.

A composition rule is a cons of global and new glyph reference point
symbols.  See the documentation of `reference-point-alist' for more
detail.

Optional 4th argument MODIFICATION-FUNC is a function to call to
adjust the composition when it gets invalid because of a change of
text in the composition.Fdecompose-region
Decompose text in the current region.

When called from a program, expects two arguments,
positions (integers or markers) specifying the region.Fcompose-string
Compose characters in string STRING.

The return value is STRING where `composition' property is put on all
the characters in it.

Optional 2nd and 3rd arguments START and END specify the range of
STRING to be composed.  They defaults to the beginning and the end of
STRING respectively.

Optional 4th argument COMPONENTS, if non-nil, is a character or a
sequence (vector, list, or string) of integers.  See the function
`compose-region' for more detail.

Optional 5th argument MODIFICATION-FUNC is a function to call to
adjust the composition when it gets invalid because of a change of
text in the composition.Fdecompose-string
Return STRING where `composition' property is removed.Fcompose-chars
Return a string from arguments in which all characters are composed.
For relative composition, arguments are characters.
For rule-based composition, Mth (where M is odd) arguments are
characters, and Nth (where N is even) arguments are composition rules.
A composition rule is a cons of glyph reference points of the form
(GLOBAL-REF-POINT . NEW-REF-POINT).  See the documentation of
`reference-point-alist' for more detail.Ffind-composition
Return information about a composition at or nearest to buffer position POS.

If the character at POS has `composition' property, the value is a list
of FROM, TO, and VALID-P.

FROM and TO specify the range of text that has the same `composition'
property, VALID-P is non-nil if and only if this composition is valid.

If there's no composition at POS, and the optional 2nd argument LIMIT
is non-nil, search for a composition toward LIMIT.

If no composition is found, return nil.

Optional 3rd argument STRING, if non-nil, is a string to look for a
composition in; nil means the current buffer.

If a valid composition is found and the optional 4th argument DETAIL-P
is non-nil, the return value is a list of FROM, TO, COMPONENTS,
RELATIVE-P, MOD-FUNC, and WIDTH.

COMPONENTS is a vector of integers, the meaning depends on RELATIVE-P.

RELATIVE-P is t if the composition method is relative, else nil.

If RELATIVE-P is t, COMPONENTS is a vector of characters to be
composed.  If RELATIVE-P is nil, COMPONENTS is a vector of characters
and composition rules as described in `compose-region'.

MOD-FUNC is a modification function of the composition.

WIDTH is a number of columns the composition occupies on the screen.Fcompose-chars-after
Compose characters in current buffer after position POS.

It looks up the char-table `composition-function-table' (which see) by
a character after POS.  If non-nil value is found, the format of the
value should be an alist of PATTERNs vs FUNCs, where PATTERNs are
regular expressions and FUNCs are functions.  If the text after POS
matches one of PATTERNs, call the corresponding FUNC with three
arguments POS, TO, and PATTERN, where TO is the end position of text
matching PATTERN, and return what FUNC returns.  Otherwise, return
nil.

FUNC is responsible for composing the text properly.  The return value
is:
  nil -- if no characters were composed.
  CHARS (integer) -- if CHARS characters were composed.

Optional 2nd arg LIMIT, if non-nil, limits the matching of text.

Optional 3rd arg OBJECT, if non-nil, is a string that contains the
text to compose.  In that case, POS and LIMIT index to the string.

This function is the default value of `compose-chars-after-function'.Fcompose-last-chars
Compose last characters.
The argument is a parameterized event of the form
	(compose-last-chars N COMPONENTS),
where N is the number of characters before point to compose,
COMPONENTS, if non-nil, is the same as the argument to `compose-region'
(which see).  If it is nil, `compose-chars-after' is called,
and that function find a proper rule to compose the target characters.
This function is intended to be used from input methods.
The global keymap binds special event `compose-last-chars' to this
function.  Input method may generate an event (compose-last-chars N COMPONENTS)
after a sequence character events.Fdecompose-composite-char
Convert CHAR to string.
This is only for backward compatibility with Emacs 20.4 and the earlier.

If optional 2nd arg TYPE is non-nil, it is `string', `list', or
`vector'.  In this case, CHAR is converted string, list of CHAR, or
vector of CHAR respectively.Fcookie
Return a random phrase from PHRASE-FILE.  When the phrase file
is read in, display STARTMSG at beginning of load, ENDMSG at end.Fcookie-insert
Insert random phrases from PHRASE-FILE; COUNT of them.  When the phrase file
is read in, display STARTMSG at beginning of load, ENDMSG at end.Fcookie-snarf
Reads in the PHRASE-FILE, returns it as a vector of strings.
Emit STARTMSG and ENDMSG before and after.  Caches the result; second
and subsequent calls on the same file won't go to disk.Fshuffle-vector
Randomly permute the elements of VECTOR (all permutations equally likely)Fcopyright-update
Update the copyright notice at the beginning of the buffer to indicate
the current year.  If optional prefix ARG is given replace the years in the
notice rather than adding the current year after them.  If necessary and
`copyright-current-gpl-version' is set, the copying permissions following the
copyright, if any, are updated as well.Fcopyright
Insert a copyright by $ORGANIZATION notice at cursor.Fcperl-mode
Major mode for editing Perl code.
Expression and list commands understand all C brackets.
Tab indents for Perl code.
Paragraphs are separated by blank lines only.
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.

Various characters in Perl almost always come in pairs: {}, (), [],
sometimes <>.  When the user types the first, she gets the second as
well, with optional special formatting done on {}.  (Disabled by
default.)  You can always quote (with \[quoted-insert]) the left
"paren" to avoid the expansion.  The processing of < is special,
since most the time you mean "less".  Cperl mode tries to guess
whether you want to type pair <>, and inserts is if it
appropriate.  You can set `cperl-electric-parens-string' to the string that
contains the parenths from the above list you want to be electrical.
Electricity of parenths is controlled by `cperl-electric-parens'.
You may also set `cperl-electric-parens-mark' to have electric parens
look for active mark and "embrace" a region if possible.'

CPerl mode provides expansion of the Perl control constructs:

   if, else, elsif, unless, while, until, continue, do,
   for, foreach, formy and foreachmy.

and POD directives (Disabled by default, see `cperl-electric-keywords'.)

The user types the keyword immediately followed by a space, which
causes the construct to be expanded, and the point is positioned where
she is most likely to want to be.  eg. when the user types a space
following "if" the following appears in the buffer: if () { or if ()
} { } and the cursor is between the parentheses.  The user can then
type some boolean expression within the parens.  Having done that,
typing \[cperl-linefeed] places you - appropriately indented - on a
new line between the braces (if you typed \[cperl-linefeed] in a POD
directive line, then appropriate number of new lines is inserted).

If CPerl decides that you want to insert "English" style construct like

            bite if angry;

it will not do any expansion.  See also help on variable
`cperl-extra-newline-before-brace'.  (Note that one can switch the
help message on expansion by setting `cperl-message-electric-keyword'
to nil.)

\[cperl-linefeed] is a convenience replacement for typing carriage
return.  It places you in the next line with proper indentation, or if
you type it inside the inline block of control construct, like

            foreach (@lines) {print; print}

and you are on a boundary of a statement inside braces, it will
transform the construct into a multiline and will place you into an
appropriately indented blank line.  If you need a usual
`newline-and-indent' behaviour, it is on \[newline-and-indent],
see documentation on `cperl-electric-linefeed'.

Use \[cperl-invert-if-unless] to change a construction of the form

	    if (A) { B }

into

            B if A;

\{cperl-mode-map}

Setting the variable `cperl-font-lock' to t switches on font-lock-mode
(even with older Emacsen), `cperl-electric-lbrace-space' to t switches
on electric space between $ and {, `cperl-electric-parens-string' is
the string that contains parentheses that should be electric in CPerl
(see also `cperl-electric-parens-mark' and `cperl-electric-parens'),
setting `cperl-electric-keywords' enables electric expansion of
control structures in CPerl.  `cperl-electric-linefeed' governs which
one of two linefeed behavior is preferable.  You can enable all these
options simultaneously (recommended mode of use) by setting
`cperl-hairy' to t.  In this case you can switch separate options off
by setting them to `null'.  Note that one may undo the extra
whitespace inserted by semis and braces in `auto-newline'-mode by
consequent \[cperl-electric-backspace].

If your site has perl5 documentation in info format, you can use commands
\[cperl-info-on-current-command] and \[cperl-info-on-command] to access it.
These keys run commands `cperl-info-on-current-command' and
`cperl-info-on-command', which one is which is controlled by variable
`cperl-info-on-command-no-prompt' and `cperl-clobber-lisp-bindings'
(in turn affected by `cperl-hairy').

Even if you have no info-format documentation, short one-liner-style
help is available on \[cperl-get-help], and one can run perldoc or
man via menu.

It is possible to show this help automatically after some idle time.
This is regulated by variable `cperl-lazy-help-time'.  Default with
`cperl-hairy' (if the value of `cperl-lazy-help-time' is nil) is 5
secs idle time .  It is also possible to switch this on/off from the
menu, or via \[cperl-toggle-autohelp].  Requires `run-with-idle-timer'.

Use \[cperl-lineup] to vertically lineup some construction - put the
beginning of the region at the start of construction, and make region
span the needed amount of lines.

Variables `cperl-pod-here-scan', `cperl-pod-here-fontify',
`cperl-pod-face', `cperl-pod-head-face' control processing of pod and
here-docs sections.  With capable Emaxen results of scan are used
for indentation too, otherwise they are used for highlighting only.

Variables controlling indentation style:
 `cperl-tab-always-indent'
    Non-nil means TAB in CPerl mode should always reindent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 `cperl-indent-left-aligned-comments'
    Non-nil means that the comment starting in leftmost column should indent.
 `cperl-auto-newline'
    Non-nil means automatically newline before and after braces,
    and after colons and semicolons, inserted in Perl code.  The following
    \[cperl-electric-backspace] will remove the inserted whitespace.
    Insertion after colons requires both this variable and
    `cperl-auto-newline-after-colon' set.
 `cperl-auto-newline-after-colon'
    Non-nil means automatically newline even after colons.
    Subject to `cperl-auto-newline' setting.
 `cperl-indent-level'
    Indentation of Perl statements within surrounding block.
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation
    of the line on which the open-brace appears.
 `cperl-continued-statement-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the
    then-clause of an if, or body of a while, or just a statement continuation.
 `cperl-continued-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a brace that starts a substatement.
    This is in addition to `cperl-continued-statement-offset'.
 `cperl-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.
 `cperl-brace-imaginary-offset'
    An open brace following other text is treated as if it the line started
    this far to the right of the actual line indentation.
 `cperl-label-offset'
    Extra indentation for line that is a label.
 `cperl-min-label-indent'
    Minimal indentation for line that is a label.

Settings for K&R and BSD indentation styles are
  `cperl-indent-level'                5    8
  `cperl-continued-statement-offset'  5    8
  `cperl-brace-offset'               -5   -8
  `cperl-label-offset'               -5   -8

CPerl knows several indentation styles, and may bulk set the
corresponding variables.  Use \[cperl-set-style] to do this.  Use
\[cperl-set-style-back] to restore the memorized preexisting values
(both available from menu).

If `cperl-indent-level' is 0, the statement after opening brace in
column 0 is indented on
`cperl-brace-offset'+`cperl-continued-statement-offset'.

Turning on CPerl mode calls the hooks in the variable `cperl-mode-hook'
with no args.

DO NOT FORGET to read micro-docs (available from `Perl' menu)
or as help on variables `cperl-tips', `cperl-problems',
`cperl-non-problems', `cperl-praise', `cperl-speed'.Fcpp-highlight-buffer
Highlight C code according to preprocessor conditionals.
This command pops up a buffer which you should edit to specify
what kind of highlighting to use, and the criteria for highlighting.
A prefix arg suppresses display of that buffer.Fcpp-parse-edit
Edit display information for cpp conditionals.Vcrisp-mode
Track status of CRiSP emulation mode.
A value of nil means CRiSP mode is not enabled.  A value of t
indicates CRiSP mode is enabled.

Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either M-x customize or the function `crisp-mode'.Fcrisp-mode
Toggle CRiSP/Brief emulation minor mode.
With ARG, turn CRiSP mode on if ARG is positive, off otherwise.Fcompleting-read-multiple
Read multiple strings in the minibuffer, with completion.
By using this functionality, a user may specify multiple strings at a
single prompt, optionally using completion.

Multiple strings are specified by separating each of the strings with
a prespecified separator character.  For example, if the separator
character is a comma, the strings 'alice', 'bob', and 'eve' would be
specified as 'alice,bob,eve'.

The default value for the separator character is the value of
`crm-default-separator' (comma).  The separator character may be
changed by modifying the value of `crm-separator'.

Continguous strings of non-separator-characters are referred to as
'elements'.  In the aforementioned example, the elements are: 'alice',
'bob', and 'eve'.

Completion is available on a per-element basis.  For example, if the
contents of the minibuffer are 'alice,bob,eve' and point is between
'l' and 'i', pressing TAB operates on the element 'alice'.

The return value of this function is a list of the read strings.

See the documentation for `completing-read' for details on the arguments:
PROMPT, TABLE, PREDICATE, REQUIRE-MATCH, INITIAL-INPUT, HIST, DEF, and
INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD.Fcustomize-set-value
Set VARIABLE to VALUE.  VALUE is a Lisp object.

If VARIABLE has a `variable-interactive' property, that is used as if
it were the arg to `interactive' (which see) to interactively read the value.

If VARIABLE has a `custom-type' property, it must be a widget and the
`:prompt-value' property of that widget will be used for reading the value.

If given a prefix (or a COMMENT argument), also prompt for a comment.Fcustomize-set-variable
Set the default for VARIABLE to VALUE.  VALUE is a Lisp object.

If VARIABLE has a `custom-set' property, that is used for setting
VARIABLE, otherwise `set-default' is used.

The `customized-value' property of the VARIABLE will be set to a list
with a quoted VALUE as its sole list member.

If VARIABLE has a `variable-interactive' property, that is used as if
it were the arg to `interactive' (which see) to interactively read the value.

If VARIABLE has a `custom-type' property, it must be a widget and the
`:prompt-value' property of that widget will be used for reading the value.

If given a prefix (or a COMMENT argument), also prompt for a comment.Fcustomize-save-variable
Set the default for VARIABLE to VALUE, and save it for future sessions.
If VARIABLE has a `custom-set' property, that is used for setting
VARIABLE, otherwise `set-default' is used.

The `customized-value' property of the VARIABLE will be set to a list
with a quoted VALUE as its sole list member.

If VARIABLE has a `variable-interactive' property, that is used as if
it were the arg to `interactive' (which see) to interactively read the value.

If VARIABLE has a `custom-type' property, it must be a widget and the
`:prompt-value' property of that widget will be used for reading the value.

If given a prefix (or a COMMENT argument), also prompt for a comment.Fcustomize
Select a customization buffer which you can use to set user options.
User options are structured into "groups".
Initially the top-level group `Emacs' and its immediate subgroups
are shown; the contents of those subgroups are initially hidden.Fcustomize-group
Customize GROUP, which must be a customization group.Fcustomize-group-other-window
Customize GROUP, which must be a customization group.Fcustomize-option
Customize SYMBOL, which must be a user option variable.Fcustomize-changed-options

customization groups, as well as older options and faces whose default
values have changed since the previous major Emacs release.

With argument SINCE-VERSION (a string), customize all user option
variables that were added (or their meanings were changed) since that
version.Fcustomize-option-other-window
Customize SYMBOL, which must be a user option variable.
Show the buffer in another window, but don't select it.Fcustomize-face
Customize SYMBOL, which should be a face name or nil.
If SYMBOL is nil, customize all faces.Fcustomize-face-other-window
Show customization buffer for face SYMBOL in other window.Fcustomize-customized

If ALL is `options', include only options.
If ALL is `faces', include only faces.
If ALL is `groups', include only groups.
If ALL is t (interactively, with prefix arg), include options which are not
user-settable, as well as faces and groups.Fcustomize-apropos-options
Customize all user options matching REGEXP.
With prefix arg, include options which are not user-settable.Fcustomize-apropos-faces
Customize all user faces matching REGEXP.Fcustomize-apropos-groups
Customize all user groups matching REGEXP.Fcustom-buffer-create
Create a buffer containing OPTIONS.
Optional NAME is the name of the buffer.
OPTIONS should be an alist of the form ((SYMBOL WIDGET)...), where
SYMBOL is a customization option, and WIDGET is a widget for editing
that option.Fcustom-buffer-create-other-window
Create a buffer containing OPTIONS.
Optional NAME is the name of the buffer.
OPTIONS should be an alist of the form ((SYMBOL WIDGET)...), where
SYMBOL is a customization option, and WIDGET is a widget for editing
that option.Fcustomize-browse
Create a tree browser for the customize hierarchy.Vcustom-file
File used for storing customization information.
The default is nil, which means to use your init file
as specified by `user-init-file'.  If you specify some other file,
you need to explicitly load that file for the settings to take effect.

When you change this variable, look in the previous custom file
(usually your init file) for the forms `(custom-set-variables ...)'
and `(custom-set-faces ...)', and copy them (whichever ones you find)
to the new custom file.  This will preserve your existing customizations.Fcustomize-save-customized
Save all user options which have been set in this session.Fcustom-save-all
Save all customizations in `custom-file'.Fcustom-menu-create
Create menu for customization group SYMBOL.
The menu is in a format applicable to `easy-menu-define'.Fcustomize-menu-create
Return a customize menu for customization group SYMBOL.
If optional NAME is given, use that as the name of the menu.
Otherwise the menu will be named `Customize'.
The format is suitable for use with `easy-menu-define'.Fcustom-declare-face
Like `defface', but FACE is evaluated as a normal argument.Fcustom-set-faces
Initialize faces according to user preferences.
The arguments should be a list where each entry has the form:

  (FACE SPEC [NOW [COMMENT]])

SPEC is stored as the saved value for FACE.
If NOW is present and non-nil, FACE is created now, according to SPEC.
COMMENT is a string comment about FACE.

See `defface' for the format of SPEC.Fcvs-status-mode
Mode used for cvs status output.Fcwarn-mode
Minor mode that highlights suspicious C and C++ constructions.

Note, in addition to enabling this minor mode, the major mode must
be included in the variable `cwarn-configuration'.  By default C and
C++ modes are included.

With ARG, turn CWarn mode on if and only if arg is positive.Fturn-on-cwarn-mode
Turn on CWarn mode.

This function is designed to be added to hooks, for example:
  (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'turn-on-cwarn-mode)Fglobal-cwarn-mode
Hightlight suspicious C and C++ constructions in all buffers.

With ARG, turn CWarn mode on globally if and only if arg is positive.Fcyrillic-encode-koi8-r-char
Return KOI8-R external character code of CHAR if appropriate.Fcyrillic-encode-alternativnyj-char
Return ALTERNATIVNYJ external character code of CHAR if appropriate.Fstandard-display-cyrillic-translit
Display a cyrillic buffer using a transliteration.
For readability, the table is slightly
different from the one used for the input method `cyrillic-translit'.

The argument is a string which specifies which language you are using;
that affects the choice of transliterations slightly.
Possible values are listed in 'cyrillic-language-alist'.
If the argument is t, we use the default cyrillic transliteration.
If the argument is nil, we return the display table to its standard state.Fdabbrev-completion
Completion on current word.
Like \[dabbrev-expand] but finds all expansions in the current buffer
and presents suggestions for completion.

With a prefix argument, it searches all buffers accepted by the
function pointed out by `dabbrev-friend-buffer-function' to find the
completions.

If the prefix argument is 16 (which comes from C-u C-u),
then it searches *all* buffers.

With no prefix argument, it reuses an old completion list
if there is a suitable one already.Fdabbrev-expand
Expand previous word "dynamically".

Expands to the most recent, preceding word for which this is a prefix.
If no suitable preceding word is found, words following point are
considered.  If still no suitable word is found, then look in the
buffers accepted by the function pointed out by variable
`dabbrev-friend-buffer-function'.

A positive prefix argument, N, says to take the Nth backward *distinct*
possibility.  A negative argument says search forward.

If the cursor has not moved from the end of the previous expansion and
no argument is given, replace the previously-made expansion
with the next possible expansion not yet tried.

The variable `dabbrev-backward-only' may be used to limit the
direction of search to backward if set non-nil.

See also `dabbrev-abbrev-char-regexp' and \[dabbrev-completion].Fdcl-mode
Major mode for editing DCL-files.

This mode indents command lines in blocks.  (A block is commands between
THEN-ELSE-ENDIF and between lines matching dcl-block-begin-regexp and
dcl-block-end-regexp.)

Labels are indented to a fixed position unless they begin or end a block.
Whole-line comments (matching dcl-comment-line-regexp) are not indented. 
Data lines are not indented.

Key bindings:

\{dcl-mode-map}
Commands not usually bound to keys:

\[dcl-save-nondefault-options]		Save changed options
\[dcl-save-all-options]		Save all options
\[dcl-save-option]			Save any option
\[dcl-save-mode]			Save buffer mode

Variables controlling indentation style and extra features:

 dcl-basic-offset
    Extra indentation within blocks.

 dcl-continuation-offset
    Extra indentation for continued lines.

 dcl-margin-offset
    Indentation for the first command line in a file or SUBROUTINE.

 dcl-margin-label-offset
    Indentation for a label.

 dcl-comment-line-regexp
    Lines matching this regexp will not be indented. 

 dcl-block-begin-regexp
 dcl-block-end-regexp
    Regexps that match command lines that begin and end, respectively,
    a block of commmand lines that will be given extra indentation.
    Command lines between THEN-ELSE-ENDIF are always indented; these variables
    make it possible to define other places to indent.
    Set to nil to disable this feature.

 dcl-calc-command-indent-function
    Can be set to a function that customizes indentation for command lines.
    Two such functions are included in the package:
	dcl-calc-command-indent-multiple
	dcl-calc-command-indent-hang

 dcl-calc-cont-indent-function
    Can be set to a function that customizes indentation for continued lines.
    One such function is included in the package:
	dcl-calc-cont-indent-relative    (set by default)

 dcl-tab-always-indent
    If t, pressing TAB always indents the current line.
    If nil, pressing TAB indents the current line if point is at the left 
    margin.

 dcl-electric-characters 
    Non-nil causes lines to be indented at once when a label, ELSE or ENDIF is
    typed.

 dcl-electric-reindent-regexps
    Use this variable and function dcl-electric-character to customize
    which words trigger electric indentation.

 dcl-tempo-comma
 dcl-tempo-left-paren
 dcl-tempo-right-paren
    These variables control the look of expanded templates.

 dcl-imenu-generic-expression
    Default value for imenu-generic-expression.  The default includes
    SUBROUTINE labels in the main listing and sub-listings for
    other labels, CALL, GOTO and GOSUB statements. 

 dcl-imenu-label-labels
 dcl-imenu-label-goto
 dcl-imenu-label-gosub
 dcl-imenu-label-call
    Change the text that is used as sub-listing labels in imenu.

Loading this package calls the value of the variable
`dcl-mode-load-hook' with no args, if that value is non-nil. 
Turning on DCL mode calls the value of the variable `dcl-mode-hook' 
with no args, if that value is non-nil.


The following example uses the default values for all variables:

$! This is a comment line that is not indented (it matches 
$! dcl-comment-line-regexp)
$! Next follows the first command line.  It is indented dcl-margin-offset.
$       i = 1
$       ! Other comments are indented like command lines.
$       ! A margin label indented dcl-margin-label-offset:
$ label: 
$       if i.eq.1
$       then
$           ! Lines between THEN-ELSE and ELSE-ENDIF are 
$           ! indented dcl-basic-offset
$           loop1: ! This matches dcl-block-begin-regexp...
$               ! ...so this line is indented dcl-basic-offset
$               text = "This " + - ! is a continued line 
                       "lined up with the command line"
$               type sys$input
Data lines are not indented at all. 
$           endloop1: ! This matches dcl-block-end-regexp
$       endif
$
Fdebug
Enter debugger.  To return, type \<debugger-mode-map>`\[debugger-continue]'.
Arguments are mainly for use when this is called from the internals
of the evaluator.

You may call with no args, or you may pass nil as the first arg and
any other args you like.  In that case, the list of args after the
first will be printed into the backtrace buffer.Fdebug-on-entry
Request FUNCTION to invoke debugger each time it is called.
If you tell the debugger to continue, FUNCTION's execution proceeds.
This works by modifying the definition of FUNCTION,
which must be written in Lisp, not predefined.
Use \[cancel-debug-on-entry] to cancel the effect of this command.
Redefining FUNCTION also cancels it.Fcancel-debug-on-entry
Undo effect of \[debug-on-entry] on FUNCTION.
If argument is nil or an empty string, cancel for all functions.Fdecipher
Format a buffer of ciphertext for cryptanalysis and enter Decipher mode.Fdecipher-mode
Major mode for decrypting monoalphabetic substitution ciphers.
Lower-case letters enter plaintext.
Upper-case letters are commands.

The buffer is made read-only so that normal Emacs commands cannot
modify it.

The most useful commands are:
\<decipher-mode-map>
\[decipher-digram-list]  Display a list of all digrams & their frequency
\[decipher-frequency-count]  Display the frequency of each ciphertext letter
\[decipher-adjacency-list]  Show adjacency list for current letter (lists letters appearing next to it)
\[decipher-make-checkpoint]  Save the current cipher alphabet (checkpoint)
\[decipher-restore-checkpoint]  Restore a saved cipher alphabet (checkpoint)Fdelimit-columns-customize
Customization of `columns' group.Fdelimit-columns-region
Prettify all columns in a text region.

START and END delimits the text region.Fdelimit-columns-rectangle
Prettify all columns in a text rectangle.

START and END delimits the corners of text rectangle.Fdelphi-mode
Major mode for editing Delphi code. \<delphi-mode-map>
\[delphi-tab]	- Indents the current line for Delphi code.
\[delphi-find-unit]	- Search for a Delphi source file.
\[delphi-fill-comment]	- Fill the current comment.
\[delphi-new-comment-line]	- If in a // comment, do a new comment line.

M-x indent-region also works for indenting a whole region.

Customization:

 `delphi-indent-level'                (default 3)
    Indentation of Delphi statements with respect to containing block.
 `delphi-compound-block-indent'       (default 0)
    Extra indentation for blocks in compound statements.
 `delphi-case-label-indent'           (default 0)
    Extra indentation for case statement labels.
 `delphi-tab-always-indents'          (default t)
    Non-nil means TAB in Delphi mode should always reindent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 `delphi-newline-always-indents'      (default t)
    Non-nil means NEWLINE in Delphi mode should always reindent the current
    line, insert a blank line and move to the default indent column of the
    blank line.
 `delphi-search-path'                 (default .)
    Directories to search when finding external units.
 `delphi-verbose'                     (default nil)
    If true then delphi token processing progress is reported to the user.

Coloring:

 `delphi-comment-face'                (default font-lock-comment-face)
    Face used to color delphi comments.
 `delphi-string-face'                 (default font-lock-string-face)
    Face used to color delphi strings.
 `delphi-keyword-face'                (default font-lock-keyword-face)
    Face used to color delphi keywords.
 `delphi-other-face'                  (default nil)
    Face used to color everything else.

Turning on Delphi mode calls the value of the variable delphi-mode-hook with
no args, if that value is non-nil.Vdelete-selection-mode
Non-nil if Delete-Selection mode is enabled.
See the command `delete-selection-mode' for a description of this minor-mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `delete-selection-mode'.Fdelete-selection-mode
Toggle Delete Selection mode.
With prefix ARG, turn Delete Selection mode on if and only if ARG is
positive.

When Delete Selection mode is enabled, Transient Mark mode is also
enabled and typed text replaces the selection if the selection is
active.  Otherwise, typed text is just inserted at point regardless of
any selection.Fdefine-derived-mode
Create a new mode as a variant of an existing mode.

The arguments to this command are as follow:

CHILD:     the name of the command for the derived mode.
PARENT:    the name of the command for the parent mode (e.g. `text-mode').
NAME:      a string which will appear in the status line (e.g. "Hypertext")
DOCSTRING: an optional documentation string--if you do not supply one,
           the function will attempt to invent something useful.
BODY:      forms to execute just before running the
           hooks for the new mode.

Here is how you could define LaTeX-Thesis mode as a variant of LaTeX mode:

  (define-derived-mode LaTeX-thesis-mode LaTeX-mode "LaTeX-Thesis")

You could then make new key bindings for `LaTeX-thesis-mode-map'
without changing regular LaTeX mode.  In this example, BODY is empty,
and DOCSTRING is generated by default.

On a more complicated level, the following command uses `sgml-mode' as
the parent, and then sets the variable `case-fold-search' to nil:

  (define-derived-mode article-mode sgml-mode "Article"
    "Major mode for editing technical articles."
    (setq case-fold-search nil))

Note that if the documentation string had been left out, it would have
been generated automatically, with a reference to the keymap.Fderived-mode-init-mode-variables
Initialise variables for a new MODE.
Right now, if they don't already exist, set up a blank keymap, an
empty syntax table, and an empty abbrev table -- these will be merged
the first time the mode is used.Fdesktop-read
Read the Desktop file and the files it specifies.
This is a no-op when Emacs is running in batch mode.Fdesktop-load-default
Load the `default' start-up library manually.
Also inhibit further loading of it.  Call this from your `.emacs' file
to provide correct modes for autoloaded files.Findian-to-devanagari
Convert IS 13194 character CHAR to Devanagari basic characters.
If CHAR is not IS 13194, return CHAR as is.Fdevanagari-to-indian
Convert Devanagari basic character CHAR to IS 13194 characters.
If CHAR is not Devanagari basic character, return CHAR as is.Findian-to-devanagari-region
Convert IS 13194 characters in region to Devanagari basic characters.
When called from a program, expects two arguments,
positions (integers or markers) specifying the region.Fdevanagari-to-indian-region
Convert Devanagari basic characters in region to Indian characters.
When called from a program, expects two arguments,
positions (integers or markers) specifying the region.Findian-to-devanagari-string
Convert Indian characters in STRING to Devanagari Basic characters.Fchar-to-glyph-devanagari
Convert Devanagari characters in STRING to Devanagari glyphs.  
Ligatures and special rules are processed.Fdevanagari-decompose-string
Decompose Devanagari string STRFdevanagari-compose-from-is13194-region
Compose IS 13194 characters in the region to Devanagari characters.Fdevanagari-decompose-to-is13194-region
Decompose Devanagari characters in the region to IS 13194 characters.Fdiary
Generate the diary window for ARG days starting with the current date.
If no argument is provided, the number of days of diary entries is governed
by the variable `number-of-diary-entries'.  This function is suitable for
execution in a `.emacs' file.Fdiary-mail-entries
Send a mail message showing diary entries for next NDAYS days.
If no prefix argument is given, NDAYS is set to `diary-mail-days'.

You can call `diary-mail-entries' every night using an at/cron job.
For example, this script will run the program at 2am daily.  Since
`emacs -batch' does not load your `.emacs' file, you must ensure that
all relevant variables are set, as done here.

#!/bin/sh
# diary-rem.sh -- repeatedly run the Emacs diary-reminder
emacs -batch \
-eval "(setq diary-mail-days 3 \
             european-calendar-style t \
             diary-mail-addr \"user@host.name\" )" \
-l diary-lib -f diary-mail-entries 
at -f diary-rem.sh 0200 tomorrow

You may have to tweak the syntax of the `at' command to suit your
system.  Alternatively, you can specify a cron entry:
0 1 * * * diary-rem.sh
to run it every morning at 1am.Vdiff-switches
*A string or list of strings specifying switches to be be passed to diff.Vdiff-command
*The command to use to run diff.Fdiff
Find and display the differences between OLD and NEW files.
Interactively the current buffer's file name is the default for NEW
and a backup file for NEW is the default for OLD.
With prefix arg, prompt for diff switches.Fdiff-backup
Diff this file with its backup file or vice versa.
Uses the latest backup, if there are several numerical backups.
If this file is a backup, diff it with its original.
The backup file is the first file given to `diff'.Fdiff-mode
Major mode for viewing/editing context diffs.
Supports unified and context diffs as well as (to a lesser extent)
normal diffs.
When the buffer is read-only, the ESC prefix is not necessary.Fdiff-minor-mode
Minor mode for viewing/editing context diffs.
\{diff-minor-mode-map}Vdired-listing-switches
*Switches passed to `ls' for dired.  MUST contain the `l' option.
May contain all other options that don't contradict `-l';
may contain even `F', `b', `i' and `s'.  See also the variable
`dired-ls-F-marks-symlinks' concerning the `F' switch.Vdired-chown-program
Name of chown command (usually `chown' or `/etc/chown').Vdired-ls-F-marks-symlinks
*Informs dired about how `ls -lF' marks symbolic links.
Set this to t if `ls' (or whatever program is specified by
`insert-directory-program') with `-lF' marks the symbolic link
itself with a trailing @ (usually the case under Ultrix).

Example: if `ln -s foo bar; ls -F bar' gives `bar -> foo', set it to
nil (the default), if it gives `bar@ -> foo', set it to t.

Dired checks if there is really a @ appended.  Thus, if you have a
marking `ls' program on one host and a non-marking on another host, and
don't care about symbolic links which really end in a @, you can
always set this variable to t.Vdired-trivial-filenames
*Regexp of files to skip when finding first file of a directory.
A value of nil means move to the subdir line.
A value of t means move to first file.Vdired-keep-marker-rename
*Controls marking of renamed files.
If t, files keep their previous marks when they are renamed.
If a character, renamed files (whether previously marked or not)
are afterward marked with that character.Vdired-keep-marker-copy
*Controls marking of copied files.
If t, copied files are marked if and as the corresponding original files were.
If a character, copied files are unconditionally marked with that character.Vdired-keep-marker-hardlink
*Controls marking of newly made hard links.
If t, they are marked if and as the files linked to were marked.
If a character, new links are unconditionally marked with that character.Vdired-keep-marker-symlink
*Controls marking of newly made symbolic links.
If t, they are marked if and as the files linked to were marked.
If a character, new links are unconditionally marked with that character.Vdired-dwim-target
*If non-nil, dired tries to guess a default target directory.
This means: if there is a dired buffer displayed in the next window,
use its current subdir, instead of the current subdir of this dired buffer.

The target is used in the prompt for file copy, rename etc.Vdired-copy-preserve-time
*If non-nil, Dired preserves the last-modified time in a file copy.
(This works on only some systems.)Fdired
"Edit" directory DIRNAME--delete, rename, print, etc. some files in it.
Optional second argument SWITCHES specifies the `ls' options used.
(Interactively, use a prefix argument to be able to specify SWITCHES.)
Dired displays a list of files in DIRNAME (which may also have
shell wildcards appended to select certain files).  If DIRNAME is a cons,
its first element is taken as the directory name and the rest as an explicit
list of files to make directory entries for.
\<dired-mode-map>You can move around in it with the usual commands.
You can flag files for deletion with \[dired-flag-file-deletion] and then
delete them by typing \[dired-do-flagged-delete].
Type \[describe-mode] after entering dired for more info.

If DIRNAME is already in a dired buffer, that buffer is used without refresh.Fdired-other-window
"Edit" directory DIRNAME.  Like `dired' but selects in another window.Fdired-other-frame
"Edit" directory DIRNAME.  Like `dired' but makes a new frame.Fdired-noselect
Like `dired' but returns the dired buffer as value, does not select it.Fdired-diff
Compare file at point with file FILE using `diff'.
FILE defaults to the file at the mark.  (That's the mark set by
\[set-mark-command], not by Dired's \[dired-mark] command.)
The prompted-for file is the first file given to `diff'.
With prefix arg, prompt for second argument SWITCHES,
 which is options for `diff'.Fdired-backup-diff
Diff this file with its backup file or vice versa.
Uses the latest backup, if there are several numerical backups.
If this file is a backup, diff it with its original.
The backup file is the first file given to `diff'.
With prefix arg, prompt for argument SWITCHES which is options for `diff'.Fdired-do-chmod
Change the mode of the marked (or next ARG) files.
This calls chmod, thus symbolic modes like `g+w' are allowed.Fdired-do-chgrp
Change the group of the marked (or next ARG) files.Fdired-do-chown
Change the owner of the marked (or next ARG) files.Fdired-do-print
Print the marked (or next ARG) files.
Uses the shell command coming from variables `lpr-command' and
`lpr-switches' as default.Fdired-do-shell-command
Run a shell command COMMAND on the marked files.
If no files are marked or a specific numeric prefix arg is given,
the next ARG files are used.  Just \[universal-argument] means the current file.
The prompt mentions the file(s) or the marker, as appropriate.

If there is output, it goes to a separate buffer.

Normally the command is run on each file individually.
However, if there is a `*' in the command then it is run
just once with the entire file list substituted there.

If there is no `*', but a `?' in the command then it is still run
on each file individually but with the filename substituted there
instead of at the end of the command.

No automatic redisplay of dired buffers is attempted, as there's no
telling what files the command may have changed.  Type
\[dired-do-redisplay] to redisplay the marked files.

The shell command has the top level directory as working directory, so
output files usually are created there instead of in a subdir.

In a noninteractive call (from Lisp code), you must specify
the list of file names explicitly with the FILE-LIST argument.Fdired-do-kill-lines
Kill all marked lines (not the files).
With a prefix argument, kill that many lines starting with the current line.
(A negative argument kills lines before the current line.)
To kill an entire subdirectory, go to its directory header line
and use this command with a prefix argument (the value does not matter).Fdired-do-compress
Compress or uncompress marked (or next ARG) files.Fdired-do-byte-compile
Byte compile marked (or next ARG) Emacs Lisp files.Fdired-do-load
Load the marked (or next ARG) Emacs Lisp files.Fdired-do-redisplay
Redisplay all marked (or next ARG) files.
If on a subdir line, redisplay that subdirectory.  In that case,
a prefix arg lets you edit the `ls' switches used for the new listing.Fdired-create-directory
Create a directory called DIRECTORY.Fdired-do-copy
Copy all marked (or next ARG) files, or copy the current file.
This normally preserves the last-modified date when copying.
When operating on just the current file, you specify the new name.
When operating on multiple or marked files, you specify a directory,
and new copies of these files are made in that directory
with the same names that the files currently have.  The default
suggested for the target directory depends on the value of
`dired-dwim-target', which see.Fdired-do-symlink
Make symbolic links to current file or all marked (or next ARG) files.
When operating on just the current file, you specify the new name.
When operating on multiple or marked files, you specify a directory
and new symbolic links are made in that directory
with the same names that the files currently have.  The default
suggested for the target directory depends on the value of
`dired-dwim-target', which see.Fdired-do-hardlink
Add names (hard links) current file or all marked (or next ARG) files.
When operating on just the current file, you specify the new name.
When operating on multiple or marked files, you specify a directory
and new hard links are made in that directory
with the same names that the files currently have.  The default
suggested for the target directory depends on the value of
`dired-dwim-target', which see.Fdired-do-rename
Rename current file or all marked (or next ARG) files.
When renaming just the current file, you specify the new name.
When renaming multiple or marked files, you specify a directory.
The default suggested for the target directory depends on the value
of `dired-dwim-target', which see.Fdired-do-rename-regexp
Rename selected files whose names match REGEXP to NEWNAME.

With non-zero prefix argument ARG, the command operates on the next ARG
files.  Otherwise, it operates on all the marked files, or the current
file if none are marked.

As each match is found, the user must type a character saying
  what to do with it.  For directions, type \[help-command] at that time.
NEWNAME may contain \=\<n> or \& as in `query-replace-regexp'.
REGEXP defaults to the last regexp used.

With a zero prefix arg, renaming by regexp affects the absolute file name.
Normally, only the non-directory part of the file name is used and changed.Fdired-do-copy-regexp
Copy selected files whose names match REGEXP to NEWNAME.
See function `dired-do-rename-regexp' for more info.Fdired-do-hardlink-regexp
Hardlink selected files whose names match REGEXP to NEWNAME.
See function `dired-do-rename-regexp' for more info.Fdired-do-symlink-regexp
Symlink selected files whose names match REGEXP to NEWNAME.
See function `dired-do-rename-regexp' for more info.Fdired-upcase
Rename all marked (or next ARG) files to upper case.Fdired-downcase
Rename all marked (or next ARG) files to lower case.Fdired-maybe-insert-subdir
Insert this subdirectory into the same dired buffer.
If it is already present, just move to it (type \[dired-do-redisplay] to refresh),
  else inserts it at its natural place (as `ls -lR' would have done).
With a prefix arg, you may edit the ls switches used for this listing.
  You can add `R' to the switches to expand the whole tree starting at
  this subdirectory.
This function takes some pains to conform to `ls -lR' output.Fdired-insert-subdir
Insert this subdirectory into the same dired buffer.
If it is already present, overwrites previous entry,
  else inserts it at its natural place (as `ls -lR' would have done).
With a prefix arg, you may edit the `ls' switches used for this listing.
  You can add `R' to the switches to expand the whole tree starting at
  this subdirectory.
This function takes some pains to conform to `ls -lR' output.Fdired-prev-subdir
Go to previous subdirectory, regardless of level.
When called interactively and not on a subdir line, go to this subdir's line.Fdired-goto-subdir
Go to end of header line of DIR in this dired buffer.
Return value of point on success, otherwise return nil.
The next char is either \n, or \r if DIR is hidden.Fdired-mark-subdir-files
Mark all files except `.' and `..' in current subdirectory.
If the Dired buffer shows multiple directories, this command
marks the files listed in the subdirectory that point is in.Fdired-kill-subdir
Remove all lines of current subdirectory.
Lower levels are unaffected.Fdired-tree-up
Go up ARG levels in the dired tree.Fdired-tree-down

Optional prefix arg is a repeat factor.
Use \[dired-hide-all] to (un)hide all directories.Fdired-hide-all
Hide all subdirectories, leaving only their header lines.
If there is already something hidden, make everything visible again.
Use \[dired-hide-subdir] to (un)hide a particular subdirectory.Fdired-do-search
Search through all marked files for a match for REGEXP.
Stops when a match is found.
To continue searching for next match, use command \[tags-loop-continue].Fdired-do-query-replace-regexp
Do `query-replace-regexp' of FROM with TO, on all marked files.
Third arg DELIMITED (prefix arg) means replace only word-delimited matches.
If you exit (\[keyboard-quit] or ESC), you can resume the query replace
with the command \[tags-loop-continue].Fdired-show-file-type
Print the type of FILE, according to the `file' command.
If FILE is a symbolic link and the optional argument DEREF-SYMLINKS is
true then the type of the file linked to by FILE is printed instead.Fdired-jump
Jump to dired buffer corresponding to current buffer.
If in a file, dired the current directory and move to file's line.
If in dired already, pop up a level and goto old directory's line.
In case the proper dired file line cannot be found, refresh the dired
buffer and try again.Fdirtrack
Determine the current directory by scanning the process output for a prompt.
The prompt to look for is the first item in `dirtrack-list'.

You can toggle directory tracking by using the function `dirtrack-toggle'.

If directory tracking does not seem to be working, you can use the
function `dirtrack-debug-toggle' to turn on debugging output.

You can enable directory tracking by adding this function to 
`comint-output-filter-functions'.
Fdisassemble
Print disassembled code for OBJECT in (optional) BUFFER.
OBJECT can be a symbol defined as a function, or a function itself
(a lambda expression or a compiled-function object).
If OBJECT is not already compiled, we compile it, but do not
redefine OBJECT if it is a symbol.Fmake-display-table
Return a new, empty display table.Fdisplay-table-slot
Return the value of the extra slot in DISPLAY-TABLE named SLOT.
SLOT may be a number from 0 to 5 inclusive, or a slot name (symbol).
Valid symbols are `truncation', `wrap', `escape', `control',
`selective-display', and `vertical-border'.Fset-display-table-slot
Set the value of the extra slot in DISPLAY-TABLE named SLOT to VALUE.
SLOT may be a number from 0 to 5 inclusive, or a name (symbol).
Valid symbols are `truncation', `wrap', `escape', `control',
`selective-display', and `vertical-border'.Fdescribe-display-table
Describe the display table DT in a help buffer.Fdescribe-current-display-table
Describe the display table in use in the selected window and buffer.Fstandard-display-8bit
Display characters in the range L to H literally.Fstandard-display-default
Display characters in the range L to H using the default notation.Fstandard-display-ascii
Display character C using printable string S.Fstandard-display-g1
Display character C as character SC in the g1 character set.
This function assumes that your terminal uses the SO/SI characters;
it is meaningless for an X frame.Fstandard-display-graphic
Display character C as character GC in graphics character set.
This function assumes VT100-compatible escapes; it is meaningless for an
X frame.Fstandard-display-underline
Display character C as character UC plus underlining.Fcreate-glyph
Allocate a glyph code to display by sending STRING to the terminal.Fstandard-display-european
Semi-obsolete way to toggle display of ISO 8859 European characters.

This function is semi-obsolete; if you want to do your editing with
unibyte characters, it is better to `set-language-environment' coupled
with either the `--unibyte' option or the EMACS_UNIBYTE environment
variable, or else customize `enable-multibyte-characters'.

With prefix argument, this command enables European character display
if arg is positive, disables it otherwise.  Otherwise, it toggles
European character display.

When this mode is enabled, characters in the range of 160 to 255
display not as octal escapes, but as accented characters.  Codes 146
and 160 display as apostrophe and space, even though they are not the
ASCII codes for apostrophe and space.

Enabling European character display with this command noninteractively
from Lisp code also selects Latin-1 as the language environment, and
selects unibyte mode for all Emacs buffers (both existing buffers and
those created subsequently).  This provides increased compatibility
for users who call this function in `.emacs'.Fdissociated-press
Dissociate the text of the current buffer.
Output goes in buffer named *Dissociation*,
which is redisplayed each time text is added to it.
Every so often the user must say whether to continue.
If ARG is positive, require ARG chars of continuity.
If ARG is negative, require -ARG words of continuity.
Default is 2.Fdoctor
Switch to *doctor* buffer and start giving psychotherapy.Vdouble-mode
Toggle Double mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `double-mode'.Fdouble-mode
Toggle Double mode.
With prefix arg, turn Double mode on iff arg is positive.

When Double mode is on, some keys will insert different strings
when pressed twice.  See variable `double-map' for details.Fdunnet
Switch to *dungeon* buffer and start game.Fgnus-earcon-display
Play sounds in message buffers.Fdefine-minor-mode
Define a new minor mode MODE.
This function defines the associated control variable MODE, keymap MODE-map,
toggle command MODE, and hook MODE-hook.

DOC is the documentation for the mode toggle command.
Optional INIT-VALUE is the initial value of the mode's variable.
Optional LIGHTER is displayed in the modeline when the mode is on.
Optional KEYMAP is the default (defvar) keymap bound to the mode keymap.
  If it is a list, it is passed to `easy-mmode-define-keymap'
  in order to build a valid keymap.  It's generally better to use
  a separate MODE-map variable than to use this argument.
The above three arguments can be skipped if keyword arguments are
used (see below).

BODY contains code that will be executed each time the mode is (dis)activated.
  It will be executed after any toggling but before running the hooks.
  BODY can start with a list of CL-style keys specifying additional arguments.
  The following keyword arguments are supported:
:group   Followed by the group name to use for any generated `defcustom'.
:global  If non-nil specifies that the minor mode is not meant to be
         buffer-local.  By default, the variable is made buffer-local.
:init-value  Same as the INIT-VALUE argument.
:lighter  Same as the LIGHTER argument.Feasy-mmode-define-global-mode
Make GLOBAL-MODE out of the buffer-local minor MODE.
TURN-ON is a function that will be called with no args in every buffer
  and that should try to turn MODE on if applicable for that buffer.
KEYS is a list of CL-style keyword arguments:
:group to specify the custom group.Feasy-mmode-define-keymap
Return a keymap built from bindings BS.
BS must be a list of (KEY . BINDING) where
KEY and BINDINGS are suitable for `define-key'.
Optional NAME is passed to `make-sparse-keymap'.
Optional map M can be used to modify an existing map.
ARGS is a list of additional keyword arguments.Feasy-mmode-defsyntax
Define variable ST as a syntax-table.
CSS contains a list of syntax specifications of the form (CHAR . SYNTAX).Feasy-menu-define
Define a menu bar submenu in maps MAPS, according to MENU.
The menu keymap is stored in symbol SYMBOL, both as its value
and as its function definition.   DOC is used as the doc string for SYMBOL.

The first element of MENU must be a string.  It is the menu bar item name.
It may be followed by the following keyword argument pairs

   :filter FUNCTION

FUNCTION is a function with one argument, the menu.  It returns the actual
menu displayed.

   :visible INCLUDE

INCLUDE is an expression; this menu is only visible if this
expression has a non-nil value.  `:include' is an alias for `:visible'.

   :active ENABLE

ENABLE is an expression; the menu is enabled for selection
whenever this expression's value is non-nil.

The rest of the elements in MENU, are menu items.

A menu item is usually a vector of three elements:  [NAME CALLBACK ENABLE]

NAME is a string--the menu item name.

CALLBACK is a command to run when the item is chosen,
or a list to evaluate when the item is chosen.

ENABLE is an expression; the item is enabled for selection
whenever this expression's value is non-nil.

Alternatively, a menu item may have the form:

   [ NAME CALLBACK [ KEYWORD ARG ] ... ]

Where KEYWORD is one of the symbols defined below.

   :keys KEYS

KEYS is a string; a complex keyboard equivalent to this menu item.
This is normally not needed because keyboard equivalents are usually
computed automatically.
KEYS is expanded with `substitute-command-keys' before it is used.

   :key-sequence KEYS

KEYS is nil, a string or a vector; nil or a keyboard equivalent to this
menu item.
This is a hint that will considerably speed up Emacs' first display of
a menu.  Use `:key-sequence nil' when you know that this menu item has no
keyboard equivalent.

   :active ENABLE

ENABLE is an expression; the item is enabled for selection
whenever this expression's value is non-nil.

   :included INCLUDE

INCLUDE is an expression; this item is only visible if this
expression has a non-nil value.

   :suffix FORM

FORM is an expression that will be dynamically evaluated and whose
value will be concatenated to the menu entry's NAME.

   :style STYLE

STYLE is a symbol describing the type of menu item.  The following are
defined:

toggle: A checkbox.
        Prepend the name with `(*) ' or `( ) ' depending on if selected or not.
radio: A radio button.
       Prepend the name with `[X] ' or `[ ] ' depending on if selected or not.
button: Surround the name with `[' and `]'.  Use this for an item in the
        menu bar itself.
anything else means an ordinary menu item.

   :selected SELECTED

SELECTED is an expression; the checkbox or radio button is selected
whenever this expression's value is non-nil.

   :help HELP

HELP is a string, the help to display for the menu item.

A menu item can be a string.  Then that string appears in the menu as
unselectable text.  A string consisting solely of hyphens is displayed
as a solid horizontal line.

A menu item can be a list with the same format as MENU.  This is a submenu.Feasy-menu-create-menu
Create a menu called MENU-NAME with items described in MENU-ITEMS.
MENU-NAME is a string, the name of the menu.  MENU-ITEMS is a list of items
possibly preceded by keyword pairs as described in `easy-menu-define'.Feasy-menu-change
Change menu found at PATH as item NAME to contain ITEMS.
PATH is a list of strings for locating the menu that
should contain a submenu named NAME.
ITEMS is a list of menu items, as in `easy-menu-define'.
These items entirely replace the previous items in that submenu.

If the menu located by PATH has no submenu named NAME, add one.
If the optional argument BEFORE is present, add it just before
the submenu named BEFORE, otherwise add it at the end of the menu.

Either call this from `menu-bar-update-hook' or use a menu filter,
to implement dynamic menus.Febnf-customize
Customization for ebnf group.Febnf-print-buffer
Generate and print a PostScript syntatic chart image of the buffer.

When called with a numeric prefix argument (C-u), prompts the user for
the name of a file to save the PostScript image in, instead of sending
it to the printer.

More specifically, the FILENAME argument is treated as follows: if it
is nil, send the image to the printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save
the PostScript image in a file with that name.  If FILENAME is a
number, prompt the user for the name of the file to save in.Febnf-print-region
Generate and print a PostScript syntatic chart image of the region.
Like `ebnf-print-buffer', but prints just the current region.Febnf-spool-buffer
Generate and spool a PostScript syntatic chart image of the buffer.
Like `ebnf-print-buffer' except that the PostScript image is saved in a
local buffer to be sent to the printer later.

Use the command `ebnf-despool' to send the spooled images to the printer.Febnf-spool-region
Generate a PostScript syntatic chart image of the region and spool locally.
Like `ebnf-spool-buffer', but spools just the current region.

Use the command `ebnf-despool' to send the spooled images to the printer.Febnf-eps-buffer
Generate a PostScript syntatic chart image of the buffer in a EPS file.

Indeed, for each production is generated a EPS file.
The EPS file name has the following form:

   <PREFIX><PRODUCTION>.eps

<PREFIX>     is given by variable `ebnf-eps-prefix'.
	     The default value is "ebnf--".

<PRODUCTION> is the production name.
	     The production name is mapped to form a valid file name.
	     For example, the production name "A/B + C" is mapped to
	     "A_B_+_C" and the EPS file name used is "ebnf--A_B_+_C.eps".

WARNING: It's *NOT* asked any confirmation to override an existing file.Febnf-eps-region
Generate a PostScript syntatic chart image of the region in a EPS file.

Indeed, for each production is generated a EPS file.
The EPS file name has the following form:

   <PREFIX><PRODUCTION>.eps

<PREFIX>     is given by variable `ebnf-eps-prefix'.
	     The default value is "ebnf--".

<PRODUCTION> is the production name.
	     The production name is mapped to form a valid file name.
	     For example, the production name "A/B + C" is mapped to
	     "A_B_+_C" and the EPS file name used is "ebnf--A_B_+_C.eps".

WARNING: It's *NOT* asked any confirmation to override an existing file.Febnf-syntax-buffer

It returns the old style symbol.Febrowse-tree-mode
Major mode for Ebrowse class tree buffers.
Each line corresponds to a class in a class tree.
Letters do not insert themselves, they are commands.
File operations in the tree buffer work on class tree data structures.
E.g.\[save-buffer] writes the tree to the file it was loaded from.

Tree mode key bindings:
\{ebrowse-tree-mode-map}Febrowse-electric-choose-tree
Return a buffer containing a tree or nil if no tree found or canceled.Febrowse-tags-complete-symbol
Perform completion on the C++ symbol preceding point.
A second call of this function without changing point inserts the next match. 
A call with prefix PREFIX reads the symbol to insert from the minibuffer with
completion.Febrowse-tags-loop-continue
Repeat last operation on files in tree.
FIRST-TIME non-nil means this is not a repetition, but the first time.
TREE-BUFFER if indirectly specifies which files to loop over.Febrowse-tags-query-replace
Query replace FROM with TO in all files of a class tree.
With prefix arg, process files of marked classes only.Febrowse-tags-search-member-use
Search for call sites of a member.

Otherwise, FILE-NAME specifies the file to save the tree in.Febrowse-statistics
Display statistics for a class tree.Felectric-buffer-list
Pops up a buffer describing the set of Emacs buffers.
Vaguely like ITS lunar select buffer; combining typeoutoid buffer
listing with menuoid buffer selection.

If the very next character typed is a space then the buffer list
window disappears.  Otherwise, one may move around in the buffer list
window, marking buffers to be selected, saved or deleted.

To exit and select a new buffer, type a space when the cursor is on
the appropriate line of the buffer-list window.  Other commands are
much like those of buffer-menu-mode.

Calls value of `electric-buffer-menu-mode-hook' on entry if non-nil.

\{electric-buffer-menu-mode-map}FElectric-command-history-redo-expression
Edit current history line in minibuffer and execute result.
With prefix arg NOCONFIRM, execute current line as-is without editing.Vedebug-all-defs
*If non-nil, evaluation of any defining forms will instrument for Edebug.
This applies to `eval-defun', `eval-region', `eval-buffer', and
`eval-current-buffer'.  `eval-region' is also called by
`eval-last-sexp', and `eval-print-last-sexp'.

You can use the command `edebug-all-defs' to toggle the value of this
variable.  You may wish to make it local to each buffer with
(make-local-variable 'edebug-all-defs) in your
`emacs-lisp-mode-hook'.Vedebug-all-forms
*Non-nil evaluation of all forms will instrument for Edebug.
This doesn't apply to loading or evaluations in the minibuffer.
Use the command `edebug-all-forms' to toggle the value of this option.Fdef-edebug-spec
Set the `edebug-form-spec' property of SYMBOL according to SPEC.
Both SYMBOL and SPEC are unevaluated. The SPEC can be 0, t, a symbol
(naming a function), or a list.Fedebug-eval-top-level-form
Evaluate a top level form, such as a defun or defmacro.
This is like `eval-defun', but the code is always instrumented for Edebug.
Print its name in the minibuffer and leave point where it is,
or if an error occurs, leave point after it with mark at the original point.Fediff-files

the same name in both.  The third argument, REGEXP, is a regular expression
that can be used to filter out certain file names.Fediff-directory-revisions
Run Ediff on a directory, DIR1, comparing its files with their revisions.
The second argument, REGEXP, is a regular expression that filters the file
names.  Only the files that are under revision control are taken into account.Fediff-directories3

that can be used to filter out certain file names.Fediff-merge-directories-with-ancestor
Merge files in directories DIR1 and DIR2 using files in ANCESTOR-DIR as ancestors.
Ediff merges files that have identical names in DIR1, DIR2.  If a pair of files
in DIR1 and DIR2 doesn't have an ancestor in ANCESTOR-DIR, Ediff will merge
without ancestor.  The fourth argument, REGEXP, is a regular expression that
can be used to filter out certain file names.Fediff-merge-directory-revisions
Run Ediff on a directory, DIR1, merging its files with their revisions.

follows:
If WIND-A is nil, use selected window.
If WIND-B is nil, use window next to WIND-A.Fediff-windows-linewise
Compare WIND-A and WIND-B, which are selected by clicking, linewise.
With prefix argument, DUMB-MODE, or on a non-windowing display, works as
follows:
If WIND-A is nil, use selected window.
If WIND-B is nil, use window next to WIND-A.Fediff-regions-wordwise
Run Ediff on a pair of regions in two different buffers.
Regions (i.e., point and mark) are assumed to be set in advance.
This function is effective only for relatively small regions, up to 200
lines.  For large regions, use `ediff-regions-linewise'.Fediff-regions-linewise
Run Ediff on a pair of regions in two different buffers.
Regions (i.e., point and mark) are assumed to be set in advance.
Each region is enlarged to contain full lines.
This function is effective for large regions, over 100-200
lines.  For small regions, use `ediff-regions-wordwise'.Fediff-merge-files
Merge two files without ancestor.Fediff-merge-files-with-ancestor
Merge two files with ancestor.Fediff-merge-buffers
Merge buffers without ancestor.Fediff-merge-buffers-with-ancestor

The file is the the optional FILE argument or the file visited by the current
buffer.Frun-ediff-from-cvs-buffer
Run Ediff-merge on appropriate revisions of the selected file.
First run after `M-x cvs-update'.  Then place the cursor on a line describing a
file and then run `run-ediff-from-cvs-buffer'.Fediff-patch-file
Run Ediff by patching SOURCE-FILENAME.
If optional PATCH-BUF is given, use the patch in that buffer
and don't ask the user.
If prefix argument, then: if even argument, assume that the patch is in a
buffer. If odd -- assume it is in a file.Fediff-patch-buffer
Run Ediff by patching BUFFER-NAME.
Without prefix argument: asks if the patch is in some buffer and prompts for
the buffer or a file, depending on the answer.
With prefix arg=1: assumes the patch is in a file and prompts for the file.
With prefix arg=2: assumes the patch is in a buffer and prompts for the buffer.Fediff-revision
Run Ediff by comparing versions of a file.
The file is an optional FILE argument or the file entered at the prompt.
Default: the file visited by the current buffer.
Uses `vc.el' or `rcs.el' depending on `ediff-version-control-package'.Fediff-version
Return string describing the version of Ediff.
When called interactively, displays the version.Fediff-documentation
Display Ediff's manual.
With optional NODE, goes to that node.Fediff-show-registry

*Non-nil if edit-kbd-macro should leave 8-bit characters intact.
Default nil means to write characters above \177 in octal notation.Fedit-kbd-macro
Edit a keyboard macro.
At the prompt, type any key sequence which is bound to a keyboard macro.
Or, type `C-x e' or RET to edit the last keyboard macro, `C-h l' to edit
the last 100 keystrokes as a keyboard macro, or `M-x' to edit a macro by
its command name.
With a prefix argument, format the macro in a more concise way.Fedit-last-kbd-macro
Edit the most recently defined keyboard macro.Fedit-named-kbd-macro
Edit a keyboard macro which has been given a name by `name-last-kbd-macro'.Fread-kbd-macro
Read the region as a keyboard macro definition.
The region is interpreted as spelled-out keystrokes, e.g., "M-x abc RET".
See documentation for `edmacro-mode' for details.
Leading/trailing "C-x (" and "C-x )" in the text are allowed and ignored.
The resulting macro is installed as the "current" keyboard macro.

In Lisp, may also be called with a single STRING argument in which case
the result is returned rather than being installed as the current macro.
The result will be a string if possible, otherwise an event vector.
Second argument NEED-VECTOR means to return an event vector always.Fformat-kbd-macro
Return the keyboard macro MACRO as a human-readable string.
This string is suitable for passing to `read-kbd-macro'.
Second argument VERBOSE means to put one command per line with comments.
If VERBOSE is `1', put everything on one line.  If VERBOSE is omitted
or nil, use a compact 80-column format.Fedt-set-scroll-margins
Set scroll margins.
Argument TOP is the top margin in number of lines or percent of window.
Argument BOTTOM is the bottom margin in number of lines or percent of window.Fedt-emulation-on
Turn on EDT Emulation.Fwith-electric-help
Pop up an "electric" help buffer.
The arguments are THUNK &optional BUFFER NOERASE MINHEIGHT.
THUNK is a function of no arguments which is called to initialize the
contents of BUFFER.  BUFFER defaults to `*Help*'.  BUFFER will be
erased before THUNK is called unless NOERASE is non-nil.  THUNK will
be called while BUFFER is current and with `standard-output' bound to
the buffer specified by BUFFER.

If THUNK returns nil, we display BUFFER starting at the top, and
shrink the window to fit.  If THUNK returns non-nil, we don't do those things.

After THUNK has been called, this function "electrically" pops up a window
in which BUFFER is displayed and allows the user to scroll through that buffer
in electric-help-mode. The window's height will be at least MINHEIGHT if
this value is non-nil.

If THUNK returns nil, we display BUFFER starting at the top, and
shrink the window to fit if `electric-help-shrink-window' is non-nil.
If THUNK returns non-nil, we don't do those things.

When the user exits (with `electric-help-exit', or otherwise), the help
buffer's window disappears (i.e., we use `save-window-excursion'), and
BUFFER is put into `default-major-mode' (or `fundamental-mode') when we exit.Veldoc-mode
*If non-nil, show the defined parameters for the elisp function near point.

For the emacs lisp function at the beginning of the sexp which point is
within, show the defined parameters for the function in the echo area.
This information is extracted directly from the function or macro if it is
in pure lisp.  If the emacs function is a subr, the parameters are obtained
from the documentation string if possible.

If point is over a documented variable, print that variable's docstring
instead.

This variable is buffer-local.Veldoc-minor-mode-string
*String to display in mode line when Eldoc Mode is enabled.Feldoc-mode
*Enable or disable eldoc mode.
See documentation for the variable of the same name for more details.

If called interactively with no prefix argument, toggle current condition
of the mode.
If called with a positive or negative prefix argument, enable or disable
the mode, respectively.Fturn-on-eldoc-mode
Unequivocally turn on eldoc-mode (see variable documentation).Felide-head
Hide header material in buffer according to `elide-head-headers-to-hide'.

The header is made invisible with an overlay.  With a prefix arg, show
an elided material again.

This is suitable as an entry on `find-file-hooks' or appropriate mode hooks.Felint-initialize
Initialize elint.Felp-instrument-function
Instrument FUNSYM for profiling.
FUNSYM must be a symbol of a defined function.Felp-instrument-list
Instrument for profiling, all functions in `elp-function-list'.
Use optional LIST if provided instead.Felp-instrument-package
Instrument for profiling, all functions which start with PREFIX.
For example, to instrument all ELP functions, do the following:

    \[elp-instrument-package] RET elp- RETFelp-results
Display current profiling results.
If `elp-reset-after-results' is non-nil, then current profiling
information for all instrumented functions are reset after results are
displayed.Freport-emacs-bug

Prompts for bug subject.  Leaves you in a mail buffer.Femerge-files
Run Emerge on two files.Femerge-files-with-ancestor
Run Emerge on two files, giving another file as the ancestor.Femerge-buffers
Run Emerge on two buffers.Femerge-buffers-with-ancestor
Run Emerge on two buffers, giving another buffer as the ancestor.Femerge-revisions
Emerge two RCS revisions of a file.Femerge-revisions-with-ancestor
Emerge two RCS revisions of a file, with another revision as ancestor.Fencoded-kbd-mode
Toggle Encoded-kbd minor mode.
With arg, turn Encoded-kbd mode on if and only if arg is positive.

You should not turn this mode on manually, instead use the command
\[set-keyboard-coding-system] which turns on or off this mode
automatically.

In Encoded-kbd mode, a text sent from keyboard is accepted
as a multilingual text encoded in a coding system set by
\[set-keyboard-coding-system].Fenriched-mode
Minor mode for editing text/enriched files.
These are files with embedded formatting information in the MIME standard
text/enriched format.
Turning the mode on runs `enriched-mode-hook'.

More information about Enriched mode is available in the file 
etc/enriched.doc  in the Emacs distribution directory.

Commands:

\<enriched-mode-map>\{enriched-mode-map}Feshell-mode
Emacs shell interactive mode.

\{eshell-mode-map}Feshell-test
Test Eshell to verify that it works as expected.Feshell
Create an interactive Eshell buffer.
The buffer used for Eshell sessions is determined by the value of
`eshell-buffer-name'.  If there is already an Eshell session active in
that buffer, Emacs will simply switch to it.  Otherwise, a new session
will begin.  A new session is always created if the the prefix
argument ARG is specified.  Returns the buffer selected (or created).Feshell-command
Execute the Eshell command string COMMAND.
With prefix ARG, insert output into the current buffer at point.Feshell-command-result
Execute the given Eshell COMMAND, and return the result.
The result might be any Lisp object.
If STATUS-VAR is a symbol, it will be set to the exit status of the
command.  This is the only way to determine whether the value returned
corresponding to a successful execution.Feshell-report-bug
Report a bug in Eshell.
Prompts for the TOPIC.  Leaves you in a mail buffer.
Please include any configuration details that might be involved.Vtags-file-name
*File name of tags table.
To switch to a new tags table, setting this variable is sufficient.
If you set this variable, do not also set `tags-table-list'.
Use the `etags' program to make a tags table file.Vtags-case-fold-search
*Whether tags operations should be case-sensitive.
A value of t means case-insensitive, a value of nil means case-sensitive.
Any other value means use the setting of `case-fold-search'.Vtags-table-list
*List of file names of tags tables to search.
An element that is a directory means the file "TAGS" in that directory.
To switch to a new list of tags tables, setting this variable is sufficient.
If you set this variable, do not also set `tags-file-name'.
Use the `etags' program to make a tags table file.Vtags-compression-info-list
*List of extensions tried by etags when jka-compr is used.
An empty string means search the non-compressed file.
These extensions will be tried only if jka-compr was activated
(i.e. via customize of `auto-compression-mode' or by calling the function
`auto-compression-mode').Vtags-add-tables
*Control whether to add a new tags table to the current list.
t means do; nil means don't (always start a new list).
Any other value means ask the user whether to add a new tags table
to the current list (as opposed to starting a new list).Vfind-tag-hook
*Hook to be run by \[find-tag] after finding a tag.  See `run-hooks'.
The value in the buffer in which \[find-tag] is done is used,
not the value in the buffer \[find-tag] goes to.Vfind-tag-default-function
*A function of no arguments used by \[find-tag] to pick a default tag.
If nil, and the symbol that is the value of `major-mode'
has a `find-tag-default-function' property (see `put'), that is used.
Otherwise, `find-tag-default' is used.Fvisit-tags-table
Tell tags commands to use tags table file FILE.
FILE should be the name of a file created with the `etags' program.
A directory name is ok too; it means file TAGS in that directory.

Normally \[visit-tags-table] sets the global value of `tags-file-name'.
With a prefix arg, set the buffer-local value instead.
When you find a tag with \[find-tag], the buffer it finds the tag
in is given a local value of this variable which is the name of the tags
file the tag was in.Ftags-table-files
Return a list of files in the current tags table.
Assumes the tags table is the current buffer.  The file names are returned
as they appeared in the `etags' command that created the table, usually
without directory names.Ffind-tag-noselect
Find tag (in current tags table) whose name contains TAGNAME.
Returns the buffer containing the tag's definition and moves its point there,
but does not select the buffer.
The default for TAGNAME is the expression in the buffer near point.

If second arg NEXT-P is t (interactively, with prefix arg), search for
another tag that matches the last tagname or regexp used.  When there are
multiple matches for a tag, more exact matches are found first.  If NEXT-P
is the atom `-' (interactively, with prefix arg that is a negative number
or just \[negative-argument]), pop back to the previous tag gone to.

If third arg REGEXP-P is non-nil, treat TAGNAME as a regexp.

A marker representing the point when this command is invoked is pushed
onto a ring and may be popped back to with \[pop-tag-mark].
Contrast this with the ring of marks gone to by the command.

See documentation of variable `tags-file-name'.Ffind-tag
Find tag (in current tags table) whose name contains TAGNAME.
Select the buffer containing the tag's definition, and move point there.
The default for TAGNAME is the expression in the buffer around or before point.

If second arg NEXT-P is t (interactively, with prefix arg), search for
another tag that matches the last tagname or regexp used.  When there are
multiple matches for a tag, more exact matches are found first.  If NEXT-P
is the atom `-' (interactively, with prefix arg that is a negative number
or just \[negative-argument]), pop back to the previous tag gone to.

If third arg REGEXP-P is non-nil, treat TAGNAME as a regexp.

A marker representing the point when this command is invoked is pushed
onto a ring and may be popped back to with \[pop-tag-mark].
Contrast this with the ring of marks gone to by the command.

See documentation of variable `tags-file-name'.Ffind-tag-other-window
Find tag (in current tags table) whose name contains TAGNAME.
Select the buffer containing the tag's definition in another window, and
move point there.  The default for TAGNAME is the expression in the buffer
around or before point.

If second arg NEXT-P is t (interactively, with prefix arg), search for
another tag that matches the last tagname or regexp used.  When there are
multiple matches for a tag, more exact matches are found first.  If NEXT-P
is negative (interactively, with prefix arg that is a negative number or
just \[negative-argument]), pop back to the previous tag gone to.

If third arg REGEXP-P is non-nil, treat TAGNAME as a regexp.

A marker representing the point when this command is invoked is pushed
onto a ring and may be popped back to with \[pop-tag-mark].
Contrast this with the ring of marks gone to by the command.

See documentation of variable `tags-file-name'.Ffind-tag-other-frame
Find tag (in current tags table) whose name contains TAGNAME.
Select the buffer containing the tag's definition in another frame, and
move point there.  The default for TAGNAME is the expression in the buffer
around or before point.

If second arg NEXT-P is t (interactively, with prefix arg), search for
another tag that matches the last tagname or regexp used.  When there are
multiple matches for a tag, more exact matches are found first.  If NEXT-P
is negative (interactively, with prefix arg that is a negative number or
just \[negative-argument]), pop back to the previous tag gone to.

If third arg REGEXP-P is non-nil, treat TAGNAME as a regexp.

A marker representing the point when this command is invoked is pushed
onto a ring and may be popped back to with \[pop-tag-mark].
Contrast this with the ring of marks gone to by the command.

See documentation of variable `tags-file-name'.Ffind-tag-regexp
Find tag (in current tags table) whose name matches REGEXP.
Select the buffer containing the tag's definition and move point there.

If second arg NEXT-P is t (interactively, with prefix arg), search for
another tag that matches the last tagname or regexp used.  When there are
multiple matches for a tag, more exact matches are found first.  If NEXT-P
is negative (interactively, with prefix arg that is a negative number or
just \[negative-argument]), pop back to the previous tag gone to.

If third arg OTHER-WINDOW is non-nil, select the buffer in another window.

A marker representing the point when this command is invoked is pushed
onto a ring and may be popped back to with \[pop-tag-mark].
Contrast this with the ring of marks gone to by the command.

See documentation of variable `tags-file-name'.Fpop-tag-mark
Pop back to where \[find-tag] was last invoked.

This is distinct from invoking \[find-tag] with a negative argument
since that pops a stack of markers at which tags were found, not from
where they were found.Fnext-file
Select next file among files in current tags table.

A first argument of t (prefix arg, if interactive) initializes to the
beginning of the list of files in the tags table.  If the argument is
neither nil nor t, it is evalled to initialize the list of files.

Non-nil second argument NOVISIT means use a temporary buffer
 to save time and avoid uninteresting warnings.

Value is nil if the file was already visited;
if the file was newly read in, the value is the filename.Ftags-loop-continue
Continue last \[tags-search] or \[tags-query-replace] command.
Used noninteractively with non-nil argument to begin such a command (the
argument is passed to `next-file', which see).

Two variables control the processing we do on each file: the value of
`tags-loop-scan' is a form to be executed on each file to see if it is
interesting (it returns non-nil if so) and `tags-loop-operate' is a form to
evaluate to operate on an interesting file.  If the latter evaluates to
nil, we exit; otherwise we scan the next file.Ftags-search
Search through all files listed in tags table for match for REGEXP.
Stops when a match is found.
To continue searching for next match, use command \[tags-loop-continue].

See documentation of variable `tags-file-name'.Ftags-query-replace
`Query-replace-regexp' FROM with TO through all files listed in tags table.
Third arg DELIMITED (prefix arg) means replace only word-delimited matches.
If you exit (\[keyboard-quit] or ESC), you can resume the query-replace
with the command \[tags-loop-continue].

See documentation of variable `tags-file-name'.Flist-tags
Display list of tags in file FILE.
This searches only the first table in the list, and no included tables.
FILE should be as it appeared in the `etags' command, usually without a
directory specification.Ftags-apropos
Display list of all tags in tags table REGEXP matches.Fselect-tags-table
Select a tags table file from a menu of those you have already used.
The list of tags tables to select from is stored in `tags-table-set-list';
see the doc of that variable if you want to add names to the list.Fcomplete-tag
Perform tags completion on the text around point.
Completes to the set of names listed in the current tags table.
The string to complete is chosen in the same way as the default
for \[find-tag] (which see).Fethio-sera-to-fidel-region
Convert the characters in region from SERA to FIDEL.
The variable `ethio-primary-language' specifies the primary language
and `ethio-secondary-language' specifies the secondary.

If the 3rd parameter SECONDARY is given and non-nil, assume the region

language and `ethio-secondary-language' specifies the secondary.

If the 1st optional parameter SECONDARY is non-nil, assume the buffer
begins with the secondary language; otherwise with the primary
language.

If the 2nd optional parametr FORCE is non-nil, perform conversion even if the
buffer is read-only.

See also the descriptions of the variables
`ethio-use-colon-for-colon' and
`ethio-use-three-dot-question'.Fethio-sera-to-fidel-mail-or-marker

Assume that each region begins with `ethio-primary-language'.
The markers "<sera>" and "</sera>" themselves are not deleted.Fethio-fidel-to-sera-region
Replace all the FIDEL characters in the region to the SERA format.
The variable `ethio-primary-language' specifies the primary
language and `ethio-secondary-language' specifies the secondary.

If the 3dr parameter SECONDARY is given and non-nil, try to convert
the region so that it begins in the secondary language; otherwise with
the primary language.

If the 4th parameter FORCE is given and non-nil, convert even if the
buffer is read-only.

See also the descriptions of the variables
`ethio-use-colon-for-colon', `ethio-use-three-dot-question',
`ethio-quote-vowel-always' and `ethio-numeric-reduction'.Fethio-fidel-to-sera-buffer
Replace all the FIDEL characters in the current buffer to the SERA format.
The variable `ethio-primary-language' specifies the primary
language and `ethio-secondary-language' specifies the secondary.

If the 1st optional parameter SECONDARY is non-nil, try to convert the
region so that it begins in the secondary language; otherwise with the
primary language.

If the 2nd optional parameter FORCE is non-nil, convert even if the
buffer is read-only.

See also the descriptions of the variables
`ethio-use-colon-for-colon', `ethio-use-three-dot-question',
`ethio-quote-vowel-always' and `ethio-numeric-reduction'.Fethio-fidel-to-sera-mail-or-marker
Execute ethio-fidel-to-sera-mail or ethio-fidel-to-sera-marker depending on the current major mode.
If in rmail-mode or in mail-mode, execute the former; otherwise latter.Fethio-fidel-to-sera-mail
Convert FIDEL to SERA to read/write mail and news.

If the body contains at least one Ethiopic character,
 1) insert the string "<sera>" at the beginning of the body,
 2) insert "</sera>" at the end of the body, and
 3) convert the body into SERA.

The very same procedure applies to the subject field, too.Fethio-fidel-to-sera-marker
Convert the regions surrounded by "<sera>" and "</sera>" from FIDEL to SERA.
The markers "<sera>" and "</sera>" themselves are not deleted.Fethio-modify-vowel

The query string consists of the buffer substring from the point back to
the preceding comma, colon or beginning of line.  
The variable `eudc-inline-query-format' controls how to associate the 
individual inline query words with directory attribute names.
After querying the server for the given string, the expansion specified by 
`eudc-inline-expansion-format' is inserted in the buffer at point.
If REPLACE is non nil, then this expansion replaces the name in the buffer.
`eudc-expansion-overwrites-query' being non nil inverts the meaning of REPLACE.
Multiple servers can be tried with the same query until one finds a match, 
see `eudc-inline-expansion-servers'Feudc-query-form

`executable-insert', `executable-query' and `executable-chmod' control
when and how magic numbers are inserted or replaced and scripts made
executable.Fexecutable-self-display
Turn a text file into a self-displaying Un*x command.
The magic number of such a command displays all lines but itself.Fexecutable-make-buffer-file-executable-if-script-p
Make file executable according to umask if not already executable.
If file already has any execute bits set at all, do not change existing
file modes.Fexpand-add-abbrevs
Add a list of abbrev to abbrev table TABLE.
ABBREVS is a list of abbrev definitions; each abbrev description entry
has the form (ABBREV EXPANSION ARG).

ABBREV is the abbreviation to replace.

EXPANSION is the replacement string or a function which will make the
expansion.  For example you, could use the DMacros or skeleton packages
to generate such functions.

ARG is an optional argument which can be a number or a list of
numbers.  If ARG is a number, point is placed ARG chars from the
beginning of the expanded text.

If ARG is a list of numbers, point is placed according to the first
member of the list, but you can visit the other specified positions
cyclicaly with the functions `expand-jump-to-previous-slot' and
`expand-jump-to-next-slot'.

If ARG is omitted, point is placed at the end of the expanded text.Fexpand-jump-to-previous-slot

Turning on F90 mode calls the value of the variable `f90-mode-hook'
with no args, if that value is non-nil.Vfacemenu-face-menu
Menu keymap for faces.Vfacemenu-foreground-menu
Menu keymap for foreground colors.Vfacemenu-background-menu
Menu keymap for background colors.Vfacemenu-special-menu
Menu keymap for non-face text-properties.Vfacemenu-justification-menu
Submenu for text justification commands.Vfacemenu-indentation-menu
Submenu for indentation commands.Vfacemenu-menu
Facemenu top-level menu keymap.Ffacemenu-set-face
Add FACE to the region or next character typed.
It will be added to the top of the face list; any faces lower on the list that
will not show through at all will be removed.

Interactively, the face to be used is read with the minibuffer.

In the Transient Mark mode, if the region is active and there is no
prefix argument, this command sets the region to the requested face.

Otherwise, this command specifies the face for the next character
inserted.  Moving point or switching buffers before
typing a character to insert cancels the specification.Ffacemenu-set-foreground
Set the foreground COLOR of the region or next character typed.
The color is prompted for.  A face named `fg:color' is used (or created).
If the region is active, it will be set to the requested face.  If
it is inactive (even if mark-even-if-inactive is set) the next
character that is typed (via `self-insert-command') will be set to
the selected face.  Moving point or switching buffers before
typing a character cancels the request.Ffacemenu-set-background
Set the background COLOR of the region or next character typed.
The color is prompted for.  A face named `bg:color' is used (or created).
If the region is active, it will be set to the requested face.  If
it is inactive (even if mark-even-if-inactive is set) the next
character that is typed (via `self-insert-command') will be set to
the selected face.  Moving point or switching buffers before
typing a character cancels the request.Ffacemenu-set-face-from-menu
Set the FACE of the region or next character typed.
This function is designed to be called from a menu; the face to use
is the menu item's name.

In the Transient Mark mode, if the region is active and there is no
prefix argument, this command sets the region to the requested face.

Otherwise, this command specifies the face for the next character
inserted.  Moving point or switching buffers before
typing a character to insert cancels the specification.Ffacemenu-set-invisible
Make the region invisible.
This sets the `invisible' text property; it can be undone with
`facemenu-remove-special'.Ffacemenu-set-intangible
Make the region intangible: disallow moving into it.
This sets the `intangible' text property; it can be undone with
`facemenu-remove-special'.Ffacemenu-set-read-only
Make the region unmodifiable.
This sets the `read-only' text property; it can be undone with
`facemenu-remove-special'.Ffacemenu-remove-face-props
Remove `face' and `mouse-face' text properties.Ffacemenu-remove-all
Remove all text properties from the region.Ffacemenu-remove-special
Remove all the "special" text properties from the region.
These special properties include `invisible', `intangible' and `read-only'.Flist-text-properties-at
Pop up a buffer listing text-properties at LOCATION.Ffacemenu-read-color
Read a color using the minibuffer.Flist-colors-display
Display names of defined colors, and show what they look like.
If the optional argument LIST is non-nil, it should be a list of
colors to display.  Otherwise, this command computes a list
of colors that the current display can handle.Ffast-lock-mode
Toggle Fast Lock mode.
With arg, turn Fast Lock mode on if and only if arg is positive and the buffer
is associated with a file.  Enable it automatically in your `~/.emacs' by:

 (setq font-lock-support-mode 'fast-lock-mode)

If Fast Lock mode is enabled, and the current buffer does not contain any text
properties, any associated Font Lock cache is used if its timestamp matches the
buffer's file, and its `font-lock-keywords' match those that you are using.

Font Lock caches may be saved:
- When you save the file's buffer.
- When you kill an unmodified file's buffer.
- When you exit Emacs, for all unmodified or saved buffers.
Depending on the value of `fast-lock-save-events'.
See also the commands `fast-lock-read-cache' and `fast-lock-save-cache'.

Use \[font-lock-fontify-buffer] to fontify the buffer if the cache is bad.

Various methods of control are provided for the Font Lock cache.  In general,
see variable `fast-lock-cache-directories' and function `fast-lock-cache-name'.
For saving, see variables `fast-lock-minimum-size', `fast-lock-save-events',
`fast-lock-save-others' and `fast-lock-save-faces'.Fturn-on-fast-lock
Unconditionally turn on Fast Lock mode.Ffeedmail-send-it
Send the current mail buffer using the Feedmail package.
This is a suitable value for `send-mail-function'.  It can be used
with various lower-level mechanisms to provide features such as queueing.Ffeedmail-run-the-queue-no-prompts
Like feedmail-run-the-queue, but suppress confirmation prompts.Ffeedmail-run-the-queue-global-prompt
Like feedmail-run-the-queue, but with a global confirmation prompt.
This is generally most useful if run non-interactively, since you can
bail out with an appropriate answer to the global confirmation prompt.Ffeedmail-run-the-queue
Visit each message in the feedmail queue directory and send it out.
Return value is a list of three things: number of messages sent, number of
messages skipped, and number of non-message things in the queue (commonly
backup file names and the like).Ffeedmail-queue-reminder
Perform some kind of reminder activity about queued and draft messages.
Called with an optional symbol argument which says what kind of event
is triggering the reminder activity.  The default is 'on-demand, which
is what you typically would use if you were putting this in your emacs start-up
or mail hook code.  Other recognized values for WHAT-EVENT (these are passed
internally by feedmail):

   after-immediate      (a message has just been sent in immediate mode)
   after-queue          (a message has just been queued)
   after-draft          (a message has just been placed in the draft directory)
   after-run            (the queue has just been run, possibly sending messages)

WHAT-EVENT is used as a key into the table feedmail-queue-reminder-alist.  If
the associated value is a function, it is called without arguments and is expected
to perform the reminder activity.  You can supply your own reminder functions
by redefining feedmail-queue-reminder-alist.  If you don't want any reminders,
you can set feedmail-queue-reminder-alist to nil.Fffap-next
Search buffer for next file or URL, and run ffap.
Optional argument BACK says to search backwards.
Optional argument WRAP says to try wrapping around if necessary.
Interactively: use a single prefix to search backwards,
double prefix to wrap forward, triple to wrap backwards.
Actual search is done by `ffap-next-guess'.Ffind-file-at-point
Find FILENAME, guessing a default from text around point.
If `ffap-url-regexp' is not nil, the FILENAME may also be an URL.
With a prefix, this command behaves exactly like `ffap-file-finder'.
If `ffap-require-prefix' is set, the prefix meaning is reversed.
See also the variables `ffap-dired-wildcards', `ffap-newfile-prompt',
and the functions `ffap-file-at-point' and `ffap-url-at-point'.

See <ftp://ftp.mathcs.emory.edu/pub/mic/emacs/> for latest version.Fffap-menu
Put up a menu of files and urls mentioned in this buffer.
Then set mark, jump to choice, and try to fetch it.  The menu is
cached in `ffap-menu-alist', and rebuilt by `ffap-menu-rescan'.
The optional RESCAN argument (a prefix, interactively) forces
a rebuild.  Searches with `ffap-menu-regexp'.Fffap-at-mouse
Find file or url guessed from text around mouse click.
Interactively, calls `ffap-at-mouse-fallback' if no guess is found.
Return value:
  * if a guess string is found, return it (after finding it)
  * if the fallback is called, return whatever it returns
  * otherwise, nilFdired-at-point
Start Dired, defaulting to file at point.  See `ffap'.Fffap-bindings
Evaluate the forms in variable `ffap-bindings'.Ffile-cache-minibuffer-complete
Complete a filename in the minibuffer using a preloaded cache.
Filecache does two kinds of substitution: it completes on names in
the cache, and, once it has found a unique name, it cycles through
the directories that the name is available in.  With a prefix argument,
the name is considered already unique; only the second substitution
(directories) is done.Vfind-ls-option
*Description of the option to `find' to produce an `ls -l'-type listing.
This is a cons of two strings (FIND-OPTION . LS-SWITCHES).  FIND-OPTION
gives the option (or options) to `find' that produce the desired output.
LS-SWITCHES is a list of `ls' switches to tell dired how to parse the output.Vfind-grep-options
*Option to grep to be as silent as possible.
On Berkeley systems, this is `-s'; on Posix, and with GNU grep, `-q' does it.
On other systems, the closest you can come is to use `-l'.Ffind-dired
Run `find' and go into Dired mode on a buffer of the output.
The command run (after changing into DIR) is

    find . \( ARGS \) -ls

except that the variable `find-ls-option' specifies what to use
as the final argument.Ffind-name-dired
Search DIR recursively for files matching the globbing pattern PATTERN,
and run dired on those files.
PATTERN is a shell wildcard (not an Emacs regexp) and need not be quoted.
The command run (after changing into DIR) is

    find . -name 'PATTERN' -lsFfind-grep-dired
Find files in DIR containing a regexp ARG and start Dired on output.
The command run (after changing into DIR) is

    find . -exec grep -s ARG {} \; -ls

Thus ARG can also contain additional grep options.Fff-get-other-file
Find the header or source file corresponding to this file.
See also the documentation for `ff-find-other-file'.

If optional IN-OTHER-WINDOW is non-nil, find the file in another window.Fff-find-other-file
Find the header or source file corresponding to this file.
Being on a `#include' line pulls in that file.

If optional IN-OTHER-WINDOW is non-nil, find the file in the other window.
If optional IGNORE-INCLUDE is non-nil, ignore being on `#include' lines.

Variables of interest include:

 - `ff-case-fold-search'
   Non-nil means ignore cases in matches (see `case-fold-search').
   If you have extensions in different cases, you will want this to be nil.

 - `ff-always-in-other-window'
   If non-nil, always open the other file in another window, unless an
   argument is given to `ff-find-other-file'.

 - `ff-ignore-include'
   If non-nil, ignores #include lines.

 - `ff-always-try-to-create'
   If non-nil, always attempt to create the other file if it was not found.

 - `ff-quiet-mode'
   If non-nil, traces which directories are being searched.

   constructs such as include files etc, and an associated method for
   extracting the filename from that construct.

 - `ff-other-file-alist'
   Alist of extensions to find given the current file's extension.

 - `ff-search-directories'
   List of directories searched through with each extension specified in
   `ff-other-file-alist' that matches this file's extension.

on VT-100 and H19 terminals.  When flow control is enabled,
you must type C-\ to get the effect of a C-s, and type C-^
to get the effect of a C-q.Vflyspell-mode-line-string
*String displayed on the modeline when flyspell is active.
Set this to nil if you don't want a modeline indicator.Fflyspell-prog-mode
Turn on `flyspell-mode' for comments and strings.Fflyspell-mode
Minor mode performing on-the-fly spelling checking.
Ispell is automatically spawned on background for each entered words.
The default flyspell behavior is to highlight incorrect words.
With no argument, this command toggles Flyspell mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, turn Flyspell minor mode on iff ARG is positive.
  
Bindings:
\[ispell-word]: correct words (using Ispell).
\[flyspell-auto-correct-word]: automatically correct word.
\[flyspell-correct-word] (or mouse-2): popup correct words.

Hooks:
flyspell-mode-hook is run after flyspell is entered.

Remark:
`flyspell-mode' uses `ispell-mode'.  Thus all Ispell options are
valid.  For instance, a personal dictionary can be used by
invoking `ispell-change-dictionary'.

Consider using the `ispell-parser' to check your text.  For instance
consider adding:
(add-hook 'tex-mode-hook (function (lambda () (setq ispell-parser 'tex))))
in your .emacs file.

flyspell-region checks all words inside a region.

flyspell-buffer checks the whole buffer.Fflyspell-mode-off
Turn Flyspell mode off.Fflyspell-region
Flyspell text between BEG and END.Fflyspell-buffer
Flyspell whole buffer.Fturn-on-follow-mode
Turn on Follow mode. Please see the function `follow-mode'.Fturn-off-follow-mode
Turn off Follow mode. Please see the function `follow-mode'.Ffollow-mode
Minor mode that combines windows into one tall virtual window.

The feeling of a "virtual window" has been accomplished by the use
of two major techniques:

* The windows always displays adjacent sections of the buffer.
  This means that whenever one window is moved, all the
  others will follow.  (Hence the name Follow Mode.)

* Should the point (cursor) end up outside a window, another
  window displaying that point is selected, if possible.  This
  makes it possible to walk between windows using normal cursor
  movement commands.

Follow mode comes to its prime when used on a large screen and two
side-by-side window are used. The user can, with the help of Follow
mode, use two full-height windows as though they would have been
one. Imagine yourself editing a large function, or section of text,
and being able to use 144 lines instead of the normal 72... (your
mileage may vary).

To split one large window into two side-by-side windows, the commands
`\[split-window-horizontally]' or `M-x follow-delete-other-windows-and-split' can be used.

Only windows displayed in the same frame follow each-other.

If the variable `follow-intercept-processes' is non-nil, Follow mode
will listen to the output of processes and redisplay accordingly.
(This is the default.)

When Follow mode is switched on, the hook `follow-mode-hook'
is called.  When turned off, `follow-mode-off-hook' is called.

Keys specific to Follow mode:
\{follow-mode-map}Ffollow-delete-other-windows-and-split
Create two side by side windows and enter Follow Mode.

Execute this command to display as much as possible of the text
in the selected window.  All other windows, in the current
frame, are deleted and the selected window is split in two
side-by-side windows. Follow Mode is activated, hence the
two windows always will display two successive pages.
(If one window is moved, the other one will follow.)

If ARG is positive, the leftmost window is selected.  If it negative,
the rightmost is selected.  If ARG is nil, the leftmost window is
selected if the original window is the first one in the frame.

To bind this command to a hotkey, place the following line
in your `~/.emacs' file, replacing [f7] by your favourite key:
    (global-set-key [f7] 'follow-delete-other-windows-and-split)Ffont-lock-mode
Toggle Font Lock mode.
With arg, turn Font Lock mode off if and only if arg is a non-positive
number; if arg is nil, toggle Font Lock mode; anything else turns Font
Lock on.
(Font Lock is also known as "syntax highlighting".)

When Font Lock mode is enabled, text is fontified as you type it:

 - Comments are displayed in `font-lock-comment-face';
 - Strings are displayed in `font-lock-string-face';
 - Certain other expressions are displayed in other faces according to the
   value of the variable `font-lock-keywords'.

To customize the faces (colors, fonts, etc.) used by Font Lock for
fontifying different parts of buffer text, use \[customize-face].

You can enable Font Lock mode in any major mode automatically by turning on in
the major mode's hook.  For example, put in your ~/.emacs:

 (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)

Alternatively, you can use Global Font Lock mode to automagically turn on Font
Lock mode in buffers whose major mode supports it and whose major mode is one
of `font-lock-global-modes'.  For example, put in your ~/.emacs:

 (global-font-lock-mode t)

There are a number of support modes that may be used to speed up Font Lock mode
in various ways, specified via the variable `font-lock-support-mode'.  Where
major modes support different levels of fontification, you can use the variable
`font-lock-maximum-decoration' to specify which level you generally prefer.
When you turn Font Lock mode on/off the buffer is fontified/defontified, though
fontification occurs only if the buffer is less than `font-lock-maximum-size'.

For example, to specify that Font Lock mode use use Lazy Lock mode as a support
mode and use maximum levels of fontification, put in your ~/.emacs:

 (setq font-lock-support-mode 'lazy-lock-mode)
 (setq font-lock-maximum-decoration t)

To add your own highlighting for some major mode, and modify the highlighting
selected automatically via the variable `font-lock-maximum-decoration', you can
use `font-lock-add-keywords'.

To fontify a buffer, without turning on Font Lock mode and regardless of buffer
size, you can use \[font-lock-fontify-buffer].

To fontify a block (the function or paragraph containing point, or a number of
lines around point), perhaps because modification on the current line caused
syntactic change on other lines, you can use \[font-lock-fontify-block].

See the variable `font-lock-defaults-alist' for the Font Lock mode default
settings.  You can set your own default settings for some mode, by setting a
buffer local value for `font-lock-defaults', via its mode hook.Fturn-on-font-lock
Turn on Font Lock mode (only if the terminal can display it).Ffont-lock-add-keywords
Add highlighting KEYWORDS for MODE.
MODE should be a symbol, the major mode command name, such as `c-mode'
or nil.  If nil, highlighting keywords are added for the current buffer.
KEYWORDS should be a list; see the variable `font-lock-keywords'.
By default they are added at the beginning of the current highlighting list.
If optional argument APPEND is `set', they are used to replace the current
highlighting list.  If APPEND is any other non-nil value, they are added at the
end of the current highlighting list.

For example:

 (font-lock-add-keywords 'c-mode
  '(("\\\=<\\(FIXME\\):" 1 font-lock-warning-face prepend)
    ("\\\=<\\(and\\|or\\|not\\)\\\=>" . font-lock-keyword-face)))

adds two fontification patterns for C mode, to fontify `FIXME:' words, even in
comments, and to fontify `and', `or' and `not' words as keywords.

When used from an elisp package (such as a minor mode), it is recommended
to use nil for MODE (and place the call in a loop or on a hook) to avoid
subtle problems due to details of the implementation.

Note that some modes have specialised support for additional patterns, e.g.,
see the variables `c-font-lock-extra-types', `c++-font-lock-extra-types',
`objc-font-lock-extra-types' and `java-font-lock-extra-types'.Ffont-lock-remove-keywords
Remove highlighting KEYWORDS for MODE.

MODE should be a symbol, the major mode command name, such as `c-mode'
or nil.  If nil, highlighting keywords are removed for the current buffer.

When used from an elisp package (such as a minor mode), it is recommended
to use nil for MODE (and place the call in a loop or on a hook) to avoid
subtle problems due to details of the implementation.Vglobal-font-lock-mode
Non-nil if Global-Font-Lock mode is enabled.
See the command `global-font-lock-mode' for a description of this minor-mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `global-font-lock-mode'.Fglobal-font-lock-mode
Toggle Font-Lock mode in every buffer.
With prefix ARG, turn Global-Font-Lock mode on if and only if ARG is positive.
Font-Lock mode is actually not turned on in every buffer but only in those
in which `turn-on-font-lock-if-enabled' turns it on.Ffont-lock-fontify-buffer
Fontify the current buffer the way the function `font-lock-mode' would.Fcreate-fontset-from-fontset-spec
Create a fontset from fontset specification string FONTSET-SPEC.
FONTSET-SPEC is a string of the format:
	FONTSET-NAME,CHARSET-NAME0:FONT-NAME0,CHARSET-NAME1:FONT-NAME1, ...
Any number of SPACE, TAB, and NEWLINE can be put before and after commas.

Optional 2nd argument is ignored.  It exists just for backward
compatibility.

If this function attempts to create already existing fontset, error is
signaled unless the optional 3rd argument NOERROR is non-nil.

It returns a name of the created fontset.Ffootnote-mode
Toggle footnote minor mode.

name. If DESCRIPTION is provided, it is used as the docstring for the new
function.

COMMENT-LIST is a list, whose entries are either a single character,
a one or two character string or a cons pair. If the entry is a character
or a one-character string, it is added to the mode's syntax table with
`comment-start' syntax.  If the entry is a cons pair, the elements of the
pair are considered to be `comment-start' and `comment-end' respectively.
Note that Emacs has limitations regarding comment characters.

KEYWORD-LIST is a list of keywords to highlight with `font-lock-keyword-face'.
Each keyword should be a string.

FONT-LOCK-LIST is a list of additional expressions to highlight. Each entry
in the list should have the same form as an entry in `font-lock-defaults-alist'

AUTO-MODE-LIST is a list of regular expressions to add to `auto-mode-alist'.
These regexps are added to `auto-mode-alist' as soon as `define-generic-mode'
is called; any old regexps with the same name are removed.

FUNCTION-LIST is a list of functions to call to do some additional setup.

See the file generic-x.el for some examples of `define-generic-mode'.Fgeneric-mode
Basic comment and font-lock functionality for `generic' files.
(Files which are too small to warrant their own mode, but have
comment characters, keywords, and the like.)

To define a generic-mode, use the function `define-generic-mode'.
Some generic modes are defined in `generic-x.el'.Fglasses-mode
Minor mode for making identifiers likeThis readable.
When this mode is active, it tries to add virtual separators (like underscores)
at places they belong to.Fgnus-slave-no-server
Read network news as a slave, without connecting to local server.Fgnus-no-server
Read network news.
If ARG is a positive number, Gnus will use that as the
startup level.	If ARG is nil, Gnus will be started at level 2.
If ARG is non-nil and not a positive number, Gnus will
prompt the user for the name of an NNTP server to use.
As opposed to `gnus', this command will not connect to the local server.Fgnus-slave
Read news as a slave.Fgnus-other-frame
Pop up a frame to read news.Fgnus
Read network news.
If ARG is non-nil and a positive number, Gnus will use that as the
startup level.	If ARG is non-nil and not a positive number, Gnus will
prompt the user for the name of an NNTP server to use.Fgnus-unplugged
Start Gnus unplugged.Fgnus-plugged
Start Gnus plugged.Fgnus-agentize
Allow Gnus to be an offline newsreader.
The normal usage of this command is to put the following as the
last form in your `.gnus.el' file:

(gnus-agentize)

This will modify the `gnus-before-startup-hook', `gnus-post-method',
and `message-send-mail-function' variables, and install the Gnus
agent minor mode in all Gnus buffers.Fgnus-agent-batch-fetch
Start Gnus and fetch session.Fgnus-article-prepare-display
Make the current buffer look like a nice article.Fgnus-audio-play
Play a sound FILE through the speaker.Fgnus-jog-cache
Go through all groups and put the articles into the cache.

Usage:
$ emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -l gnus -f gnus-jog-cacheFgnus-cache-generate-active
Generate the cache active file.Fgnus-cache-generate-nov-databases
Generate NOV files recursively starting in DIR.Fgnus-fetch-group
Start Gnus if necessary and enter GROUP.
Returns whether the fetching was successful or not.Fgnus-fetch-group-other-frame
Pop up a frame and enter GROUP.Fgnus-batch-score
Run batched scoring.
Usage: emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -l gnus -f gnus-batch-scoreFgnus-mailing-list-mode
Minor mode for providing mailing-list commands.

\{gnus-mailing-list-mode-map}Fgnus-group-split-setup
Set up the split for nnmail-split-fancy.
Sets things up so that nnmail-split-fancy is used for mail
splitting, and defines the variable nnmail-split-fancy according with
group parameters.

If AUTO-UPDATE is non-nil (prefix argument accepted, if called
interactively), it makes sure nnmail-split-fancy is re-computed before
getting new mail, by adding gnus-group-split-update to
nnmail-pre-get-new-mail-hook.

A non-nil CATCH-ALL replaces the current value of
gnus-group-split-default-catch-all-group.  This variable is only used
by gnus-group-split-update, and only when its CATCH-ALL argument is
nil.  This argument may contain any fancy split, that will be added as
the last split in a `|' split produced by gnus-group-split-fancy,
unless overridden by any group marked as a catch-all group.  Typical
uses are as simple as the name of a default mail group, but more
elaborate fancy splits may also be useful to split mail that doesn't
match any of the group-specified splitting rules.  See
gnus-group-split-fancy for details.Fgnus-group-split-update
Computes nnmail-split-fancy from group params and CATCH-ALL, by
calling (gnus-group-split-fancy nil nil CATCH-ALL).

If CATCH-ALL is nil, gnus-group-split-default-catch-all-group is used
instead.  This variable is set by gnus-group-split-setup.Fgnus-group-split
Uses information from group parameters in order to split mail.
See gnus-group-split-fancy for more information.

gnus-group-split is a valid value for nnmail-split-methods.Fgnus-group-split-fancy
Uses information from group parameters in order to split mail.
It can be embedded into `nnmail-split-fancy' lists with the SPLIT

(: gnus-group-split-fancy GROUPS NO-CROSSPOST CATCH-ALL)

GROUPS may be a regular expression or a list of group names, that will
be used to select candidate groups.  If it is ommited or nil, all
existing groups are considered.

if NO-CROSSPOST is ommitted or nil, a & split will be returned,
otherwise, a | split, that does not allow crossposting, will be
returned.

For each selected group, a SPLIT is composed like this: if SPLIT-SPEC
is specified, this split is returned as-is (unless it is nil: in this
case, the group is ignored).  Otherwise, if TO-ADDRESS, TO-LIST and/or
EXTRA-ALIASES are specified, a regexp that matches any of them is
constructed (extra-aliases may be a list).  Additionally, if
SPLIT-REGEXP is specified, the regexp will be extended so that it
matches this regexp too, and if SPLIT-EXCLUDE is specified, RESTRICT
clauses will be generated.

If CATCH-ALL is nil, no catch-all handling is performed, regardless of
catch-all marks in group parameters.  Otherwise, if there is no
selected group whose SPLIT-REGEXP matches the empty string, nor is
there a selected group whose SPLIT-SPEC is 'catch-all, this fancy
split (say, a group name) will be appended to the returned SPLIT list,
as the last element of a '| SPLIT.

For example, given the following group parameters:

nnml:mail.bar:
((to-address . "bar@femail.com")
 (split-regexp . ".*@femail\\.com"))
nnml:mail.foo:
((to-list . "foo@nowhere.gov")
 (extra-aliases "foo@localhost" "foo-redist@home")
 (split-exclude "bugs-foo" "rambling-foo")
 (admin-address . "foo-request@nowhere.gov"))
nnml:mail.others:
((split-spec . catch-all))

Calling (gnus-group-split-fancy nil nil "mail.misc") returns:

(| (& (any "\\(bar@femail\\.com\\|.*@femail\\.com\\)"
	   "mail.bar")
      (any "\\(foo@nowhere\\.gov\\|foo@localhost\\|foo-redist@home\\)"
           - "bugs-foo" - "rambling-foo" "mail.foo"))
   "mail.others")Fgnus-change-server
Move from FROM-SERVER to TO-SERVER.
Update the .newsrc.eld file to reflect the change of nntp server.Fgnus-msg-mail
Start editing a mail message to be sent.
Like `message-mail', but with Gnus paraphernalia, particularly the
Gcc: header for archiving purposes.Fgnus-mule-add-group
Specify that articles of news group NAME are encoded in CODING-SYSTEM.
All news groups deeper than NAME are also the target.
If CODING-SYSTEM is a cons, the car part is used and the cdr
part is ignored.

This function exists for backward comaptibility with Emacs 20.  It is
recommended to customize the variable `gnus-group-charset-alist'
rather than using this function.Fgnus-batch-brew-soup
Brew a SOUP packet from groups mention on the command line.
Will use the remaining command line arguments as regular expressions
for matching on group names.

For instance, if you want to brew on all the nnml groups, as well as
groups with "emacs" in the name, you could say something like:

$ emacs -batch -f gnus-batch-brew-soup ^nnml ".*emacs.*"

Note -- this function hasn't been implemented yet.Fgnus-update-format
Update the format specification near point.Fgnus-unload
Unload all Gnus features.
(For some value of `all' or `Gnus'.)  Currently, features whose names
have prefixes `gnus-', `nn', `mm-' or `rfc' are unloaded.  Use
cautiously -- unloading may cause trouble.Fgnus-declare-backend
Declare backend NAME with ABILITIES as a Gnus backend.Fgnus-add-configuration
Add the window configuration CONF to `gnus-buffer-configuration'.Fgomoku
Start a Gomoku game between you and Emacs.
If a game is in progress, this command allow you to resume it.
If optional arguments N and M are given, an N by M board is used.
If prefix arg is given for N, M is prompted for.

You and Emacs play in turn by marking a free square.  You mark it with X
and Emacs marks it with O. The winner is the first to get five contiguous
marks horizontally, vertically or in diagonal.

You play by moving the cursor over the square you choose and hitting
\<gomoku-mode-map>\[gomoku-human-plays].
Use \[describe-mode] for more info.Fgoto-address-at-mouse
Send to the e-mail address or load the URL clicked with the mouse.
Send mail to address at position of mouse click.  See documentation for
`goto-address-find-address-at-point'.  If no address is found
there, then load the URL at or before the position of the mouse click.Fgoto-address-at-point
Send to the e-mail address or load the URL at point.
Send mail to address at point.  See documentation for
`goto-address-find-address-at-point'.  If no address is found
there, then load the URL at or before point.Fgoto-address
Sets up goto-address functionality in the current buffer.
Allows user to use mouse/keyboard command to click to go to a URL
or to send e-mail.
By default, goto-address binds to mouse-2 and C-c RET.

Also fontifies the buffer appropriately (see `goto-address-fontify-p' and
`goto-address-highlight-p' for more information).Fgs-load-image
Load a PS image for display on FRAME.
SPEC is an image specification, IMG-HEIGHT and IMG-WIDTH are width
and height of the image in pixels.  WINDOW-AND-PIXMAP-ID is a string of
the form "WINDOW-ID PIXMAP-ID".  Value is non-nil if successful.Fgdb
Run gdb on program FILE in buffer *gud-FILE*.
The directory containing FILE becomes the initial working directory
and source-file directory for your debugger.Fsdb
Run sdb on program FILE in buffer *gud-FILE*.
The directory containing FILE becomes the initial working directory
and source-file directory for your debugger.Fdbx
Run dbx on program FILE in buffer *gud-FILE*.
The directory containing FILE becomes the initial working directory
and source-file directory for your debugger.Fxdb
Run xdb on program FILE in buffer *gud-FILE*.
The directory containing FILE becomes the initial working directory
and source-file directory for your debugger.

You can set the variable 'gud-xdb-directories' to a list of program source
directories if your program contains sources from more than one directory.Fperldb
Run perldb on program FILE in buffer *gud-FILE*.
The directory containing FILE becomes the initial working directory
and source-file directory for your debugger.Fpdb
Run pdb on program FILE in buffer `*gud-FILE*'.
The directory containing FILE becomes the initial working directory
and source-file directory for your debugger.Fjdb
Run jdb with command line COMMAND-LINE in a buffer.  The buffer is named
"*gud*" if no initial class is given or "*gud-<initial-class-basename>*"
if there is.  If the "-classpath" switch is given, omit all whitespace
between it and it's value.Fhandwrite
Turns the buffer into a "handwritten" document.
The functions `handwrite-10pt', `handwrite-11pt', `handwrite-12pt'
and `handwrite-13pt' set up for various sizes of output.

Variables: handwrite-linespace     (default 12)
           handwrite-fontsize      (default 11)
           handwrite-numlines      (default 60)
           handwrite-pagenumbering (default nil)Fhanoi
Towers of Hanoi diversion.  Use NRINGS rings.Fhanoi-unix
Towers of Hanoi, UNIX doomsday version.
Displays 32-ring towers that have been progressing at one move per
second since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 GMT.

Repent before ring 31 moves.Fhanoi-unix-64
Like hanoi-unix, but pretend to have a 64-bit clock.  
This is, necessarily (as of emacs 20.3), a crock.  When the
current-time interface is made s2G-compliant, hanoi.el will need
to be updated.Vthree-step-help
*Non-nil means give more info about Help command in three steps.
The three steps are simple prompt, prompt with all options,
and window listing and describing the options.
A value of nil means skip the middle step, so that
\[help-command] \[help-command] gives the window that lists the options.FHelper-describe-bindings
Describe local key bindings of current mode.FHelper-help
Provide help for current mode.Fhexl-mode
\<hexl-mode-map>A mode for editing binary files in hex dump format.
This is not an ordinary major mode; it alters some aspects
if the current mode's behavior, but not all; also, you can exit
Hexl mode and return to the previous mode using `hexl-mode-exit'.

This function automatically converts a buffer into the hexl format
using the function `hexlify-buffer'.

Each line in the buffer has an "address" (displayed in hexadecimal)
representing the offset into the file that the characters on this line
are at and 16 characters from the file (displayed as hexadecimal
values grouped every 16 bits) and as their ASCII values.

If any of the characters (displayed as ASCII characters) are
unprintable (control or meta characters) they will be replaced as
periods.

If `hexl-mode' is invoked with an argument the buffer is assumed to be
in hexl format.

A sample format:

  HEX ADDR: 0001 0203 0405 0607 0809 0a0b 0c0d 0e0f     ASCII-TEXT
  --------  ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----  ----------------

Movement is as simple as movement in a normal emacs text buffer.  Most
cursor movement bindings are the same (ie. Use \[hexl-backward-char], \[hexl-forward-char], \[hexl-next-line], and \[hexl-previous-line]
to move the cursor left, right, down, and up).

Advanced cursor movement commands (ala \[hexl-beginning-of-line], \[hexl-end-of-line], \[hexl-beginning-of-buffer], and \[hexl-end-of-buffer]) are
also supported.

There are several ways to change text in hexl mode:

ASCII characters (character between space (0x20) and tilde (0x7E)) are
bound to self-insert so you can simply type the character and it will
insert itself (actually overstrike) into the buffer.

\[hexl-quoted-insert] followed by another keystroke allows you to insert the key even if
it isn't bound to self-insert.  An octal number can be supplied in place
of another key to insert the octal number's ASCII representation.

\[hexl-insert-hex-char] will insert a given hexadecimal value (if it is between 0 and 0xFF)
into the buffer at the current point.

\[hexl-insert-octal-char] will insert a given octal value (if it is between 0 and 0377)
into the buffer at the current point.

\[hexl-insert-decimal-char] will insert a given decimal value (if it is between 0 and 255)
into the buffer at the current point.

\[hexl-mode-exit] will exit hexl-mode.

Note: saving the file with any of the usual Emacs commands
will actually convert it back to binary format while saving.

You can use \[hexl-find-file] to visit a file in Hexl mode.

\[describe-bindings] for advanced commands.Fhexl-find-file
Edit file FILENAME in hexl-mode.
Switch to a buffer visiting file FILENAME, creating one in none exists.Fhexlify-buffer
Convert a binary buffer to hexl format.
This discards the buffer's undo information.Vhi-lock-mode
Toggle hi-lock, for interactively adding font-lock text-highlighting patterns.Fhi-lock-mode
Toggle minor mode for interactively adding font-lock highlighting patterns.

If ARG positive turn hi-lock on.  Issuing a hi-lock command will also
turn hi-lock on.  When hi-lock is turned on, a "Regexp Highlighting"
submenu is added to the "Edit" menu.  The commands in the submenu,
which can be called interactively, are:

\[highlight-regexp] REGEXP FACE
  Highlight matches of pattern REGEXP in current buffer with FACE.

\[highlight-phrase] PHRASE FACE
  Highlight matches of phrase PHRASE in current buffer with FACE.
  (PHRASE can be any REGEXP, but spaces will be replaced by matches
  to whitespace and initial lower-case letters will become case insensitive.)
 
\[highlight-lines-matching-regexp] REGEXP FACE
  Highlight lines containing matches of REGEXP in current buffer with FACE.

\[unhighlight-regexp] REGEXP
  Remove highlighting on matches of REGEXP in current buffer.

\[hi-lock-write-interactive-patterns]
  Write active REGEXPs into buffer as comments (if possible). They will
  be read the next time file is loaded or when the \[hi-lock-find-patterns] command
  is issued.  The inserted regexps are in the form of font lock keywords.
  (See `font-lock-keywords') They may be edited and re-loaded with \[hi-lock-find-patterns],
  any valid `font-lock-keywords' form is acceptable.

\[hi-lock-find-patterns]
  Re-read patterns stored in buffer (in the format produced by \[hi-lock-write-interactive-patterns]).

When hi-lock is started and if the mode is not excluded, the
beginning of the buffer is searched for lines of the form:
  Hi-lock: FOO
where FOO is a list of patterns. These are added to the font lock keywords
already present.  The patterns must start before position (number
of characters into buffer) `hi-lock-file-patterns-range'.  Patterns
will be read until
 Hi-lock: end
is found. A mode is excluded if it's in the list `hi-lock-exclude-modes'.Fhi-lock-line-face-buffer
Set face of all lines containing a match of REGEXP to FACE.

Interactively, prompt for REGEXP then FACE.  Buffer-local history
list maintained for regexps, global history maintained for faces.
\<minibuffer-local-map>Use \[next-history-element] and \[previous-history-element] to retrieve next or previous history item.
(See info node `Minibuffer History')Fhi-lock-face-buffer
Set face of each match of REGEXP to FACE.

Interactively, prompt for REGEXP then FACE.  Buffer-local history
list maintained for regexps, global history maintained for faces.
\<minibuffer-local-map>Use \[next-history-element] and \[previous-history-element] to retrieve next or previous history item.
(See info node `Minibuffer History')Fhi-lock-face-phrase-buffer
Set face of each match of phrase REGEXP to FACE.

Whitespace in REGEXP converted to arbitrary whitespace and initial
lower-case letters made case insensitive.Fhi-lock-unface-buffer
Remove highlighting of each match to REGEXP set by hi-lock.

Interactively, prompt for REGEXP.  Buffer-local history of inserted
regexp's maintained.  Will accept only regexps inserted by hi-lock
interactive functions.  (See `hi-lock-interactive-patterns'.)
\<minibuffer-local-must-match-map>Use \[minibuffer-complete] to complete a partially typed regexp.
(See info node `Minibuffer History'.)Fhi-lock-write-interactive-patterns
Write interactively added patterns, if any, into buffer at point.

Interactively added patterns are those normally specified using
`highlight-regexp' and `highlight-lines-matching-regexp'; they can
be found in variable `hi-lock-interactive-patterns'.Vhide-ifdef-mode
Non-nil when hide-ifdef-mode is activated.Fhide-ifdef-mode
Toggle Hide-Ifdef mode.  This is a minor mode, albeit a large one.
With ARG, turn Hide-Ifdef mode on if arg is positive, off otherwise.
In Hide-Ifdef mode, code within #ifdef constructs that the C preprocessor
would eliminate may be hidden from view.  Several variables affect
how the hiding is done:

hide-ifdef-env
	An association list of defined and undefined symbols for the
	current buffer.  Initially, the global value of `hide-ifdef-env'
	is used.

hide-ifdef-define-alist
	An association list of defined symbol lists.  
        Use `hide-ifdef-set-define-alist' to save the current `hide-ifdef-env'
        and `hide-ifdef-use-define-alist' to set the current `hide-ifdef-env'
        from one of the lists in `hide-ifdef-define-alist'.

hide-ifdef-lines
	Set to non-nil to not show #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, and
	#endif lines when hiding.

hide-ifdef-initially
	Indicates whether `hide-ifdefs' should be called when Hide-Ifdef mode
	is activated.

hide-ifdef-read-only
	Set to non-nil if you want to make buffers read only while hiding.
	After `show-ifdefs', read-only status is restored to previous value.

\{hide-ifdef-mode-map}Vhide-ifdef-initially
*Non-nil means call `hide-ifdefs' when Hide-Ifdef mode is first activated.Vhide-ifdef-read-only
*Set to non-nil if you want buffer to be read-only while hiding text.Vhide-ifdef-lines
*Non-nil means hide the #ifX, #else, and #endif lines.Vhs-hide-comments-when-hiding-all
*Hide the comments too when you do an `hs-hide-all'.Vhs-special-modes-alist
*Alist for initializing the hideshow variables for different modes.
Each element has the form
  (MODE START END COMMENT-START FORWARD-SEXP-FUNC ADJUST-BEG-FUNC).

If non-nil, hideshow will use these values as regexps to define blocks
and comments, respectively for major mode MODE.

START, END and COMMENT-START are regular expressions.  A block is
defined as text surrounded by START and END.

As a special case, START may be a list of the form (COMPLEX-START
MDATA-SELECTOR), where COMPLEX-START is a regexp w/ multiple parts and
MDATA-SELECTOR an integer that specifies which sub-match is the proper
place to adjust point, before calling `hs-forward-sexp-func'.  For
example, see the `hs-special-modes-alist' entry for `bibtex-mode'.

For some major modes, `forward-sexp' does not work properly.  In those
cases, FORWARD-SEXP-FUNC specifies another function to use instead.

See the documentation for `hs-adjust-block-beginning' to see what is the
use of ADJUST-BEG-FUNC.

If any of the elements is left nil or omitted, hideshow tries to guess
appropriate values.  The regexps should not contain leading or trailing
whitespace.  Case does not matter.Fhs-minor-mode
Toggle hideshow minor mode.
With ARG, turn hideshow minor mode on if ARG is positive, off otherwise.
When hideshow minor mode is on, the menu bar is augmented with hideshow
commands and the hideshow commands are enabled.
The value '(hs . t) is added to `buffer-invisibility-spec'.

The main commands are: `hs-hide-all', `hs-show-all', `hs-hide-block',
`hs-show-block', `hs-hide-level' and `hs-toggle-hiding'.  There is also
`hs-hide-initial-comment-block' and `hs-mouse-toggle-hiding'.

Turning hideshow minor mode off reverts the menu bar and the
variables to default values and disables the hideshow commands.

Lastly, the normal hook `hs-minor-mode-hook' is run using `run-hooks'.

Key bindings:
\{hs-minor-mode-map}Fhighlight-changes-remove-highlight
Remove the change face from the region between BEG and END.  
This allows you to manually remove highlighting from uninteresting changes.Fhighlight-changes-mode
Toggle (or initially set) Highlight Changes mode.

Without an argument: 
  If Highlight Changes mode is not enabled, then enable it (in either active
  or passive state as determined by the variable
  `highlight-changes-initial-state'); otherwise, toggle between active
  and passive state.

With an argument ARG:
  If ARG is positive, set state to active;
  If ARG is zero, set state to passive;
  If ARG is negative, disable Highlight Changes mode completely.

Active state  - means changes are shown in a distinctive face.
Passive state - means changes are kept and new ones recorded but are
		not displayed in a different face.

Functions:
\[highlight-changes-next-change] - move point to beginning of next change
\[highlight-changes-previous-change] - move to beginning of previous change 
\[highlight-compare-with-file] - mark text as changed by comparing this
	buffer with the contents of a file
\[highlight-changes-remove-highlight] - remove the change face from the region
\[highlight-changes-rotate-faces] - rotate different "ages" of changes through 
	various faces.

Hook variables:
`highlight-changes-enable-hook'  - when enabling Highlight Changes mode.
`highlight-changes-toggle-hook'  - when entering active or passive state
`highlight-changes-disable-hook' - when turning off Highlight Changes mode.Fhighlight-changes-next-change
Move to the beginning of the next change, if in Highlight Changes mode.Fhighlight-changes-previous-change
Move to the beginning of the previous change, if in Highlight Changes mode.Fhighlight-changes-rotate-faces
Rotate the faces used by Highlight Changes mode.

Current changes are displayed in the face described by the first element
of `highlight-changes-face-list', one level older changes are shown in
face described by the second element, and so on.  Very old changes remain
shown in the last face in the list.

You can automatically rotate colours when the buffer is saved
by adding the following to `local-write-file-hooks',  by evaling it in the
buffer to be saved):

  (add-hook 'local-write-file-hooks 'highlight-changes-rotate-faces)Fhighlight-compare-with-file
Compare this buffer with a file, and highlight differences.

The current buffer must be an unmodified buffer visiting a file,
and must not be read-only.

If the buffer has a backup filename, it is used as the default when
this function is called interactively.

If the current buffer is visiting the file being compared against, it
also will have its differences highlighted.  Otherwise, the file is
read in temporarily but the buffer is deleted.

If the buffer is read-only, differences will be highlighted but no property
changes are made, so \[highlight-changes-next-change] and
\[highlight-changes-previous-change] will not work.Fglobal-highlight-changes
Turn on or off global Highlight Changes mode.

When called interactively:
- if no prefix, toggle global Highlight Changes mode on or off
- if called with a positive prefix (or just C-u) turn it on in active mode
- if called with a zero prefix  turn it on in passive mode
- if called with a negative prefix turn it off

When called from a program:
- if ARG is nil or omitted, turn it off
- if ARG is `active',  turn it on in active mode
- if ARG is `passive', turn it on in passive mode
- otherwise just turn it on 

When global Highlight Changes mode is enabled, Highlight Changes mode is turned
on for future "suitable" buffers (and for "suitable" existing buffers if
variable `highlight-changes-global-changes-existing-buffers' is non-nil).
"Suitability" is determined by variable `highlight-changes-global-modes'.Vhippie-expand-try-functions-list
The list of expansion functions tried in order by `hippie-expand'.
To change the behavior of `hippie-expand', remove, change the order of,
or insert functions in this list.Vhippie-expand-verbose
*Non-nil makes `hippie-expand' output which function it is trying.Vhippie-expand-dabbrev-skip-space
*Non-nil means tolerate trailing spaces in the abbreviation to expand.Vhippie-expand-dabbrev-as-symbol
*Non-nil means expand as symbols, i.e. syntax `_' is considered a letter.Vhippie-expand-no-restriction
*Non-nil means that narrowed buffers are widened during search.Vhippie-expand-max-buffers
*The maximum number of buffers (apart from the current) searched.
If nil, all buffers are searched.Vhippie-expand-ignore-buffers
*A list specifying which buffers not to search (if not current).
Can contain both regexps matching buffer names (as strings) and major modes
(as atoms)Vhippie-expand-only-buffers
*A list specifying the only buffers to search (in addition to current).
Can contain both regexps matching buffer names (as strings) and major modes
(as atoms). If non-NIL, this variable overrides the variable
`hippie-expand-ignore-buffers'.Fhippie-expand
Try to expand text before point, using multiple methods.
The expansion functions in `hippie-expand-try-functions-list' are
tried in order, until a possible expansion is found.  Repeated
application of `hippie-expand' inserts successively possible
expansions.  
With a positive numeric argument, jumps directly to the ARG next
function in this list.  With a negative argument or just \[universal-argument], 
undoes the expansion.Fmake-hippie-expand-function
Construct a function similar to `hippie-expand'.
Make it use the expansion functions in TRY-LIST.  An optional second
argument VERBOSE non-nil makes the function verbose.Fhl-line-mode
Minor mode to highlight the line about point in the current window.
With ARG, turn Hl-Line mode on if ARG is positive, off otherwise.
Uses functions `hl-line-unhighlight' and `hl-line-highlight' on
`pre-command-hook' and `post-command-hook'.Vglobal-hl-line-mode
Non-nil if Global-Hl-Line mode is enabled.
See the command `global-hl-line-mode' for a description of this minor-mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `global-hl-line-mode'.Fglobal-hl-line-mode
Toggle Hl-Line mode in every buffer.
With prefix ARG, turn Global-Hl-Line mode on if and only if ARG is positive.
Hl-Line mode is actually not turned on in every buffer but only in those
in which `hl-line-mode' turns it on.Fholidays
Display the holidays for last month, this month, and next month.
If called with an optional prefix argument, prompts for month and year.

This function is suitable for execution in a .emacs file.Flist-holidays
Display holidays for years Y1 to Y2 (inclusive).

The optional list of holidays L defaults to `calendar-holidays'.  See the
documentation for that variable for a description of holiday lists.

The optional LABEL is used to label the buffer created.Fturn-on-hscroll
This function is obsolete.
Emacs now does hscrolling automatically, if `truncate-lines' is non-nil.
Also see `automatic-hscrolling'.Fhscroll-mode
This function is obsolete.
Emacs now does hscrolling automatically, if `truncate-lines' is non-nil.
Also see `automatic-hscrolling'.Fhscroll-global-mode
This function is obsolete.
Emacs now does hscrolling automatically, if `truncate-lines' is non-nil.
Also see `automatic-hscrolling'.Ficomplete-mode
Toggle incremental minibuffer completion for this Emacs session.
With a numeric argument, turn Icomplete mode on iff ARG is positive.Ficomplete-minibuffer-setup
Run in minibuffer on activation to establish incremental completion.
Usually run by inclusion in `minibuffer-setup-hook'.Ficon-mode
Major mode for editing Icon code.
Expression and list commands understand all Icon brackets.
Tab indents for Icon code.
Paragraphs are separated by blank lines only.
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.
\{icon-mode-map}
Variables controlling indentation style:
 icon-tab-always-indent
    Non-nil means TAB in Icon mode should always reindent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 icon-auto-newline
    Non-nil means automatically newline before and after braces
    inserted in Icon code.
 icon-indent-level
    Indentation of Icon statements within surrounding block.
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation
    of the line on which the open-brace appears.
 icon-continued-statement-offset
    Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the
    then-clause of an if or body of a while.
 icon-continued-brace-offset
    Extra indentation given to a brace that starts a substatement.
    This is in addition to `icon-continued-statement-offset'.
 icon-brace-offset
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.
 icon-brace-imaginary-offset
    An open brace following other text is treated as if it were
    this far to the right of the start of its line.

Turning on Icon mode calls the value of the variable `icon-mode-hook'
with no args, if that value is non-nil.Fidlwave-shell
Run an inferior IDL, with I/O through buffer `(idlwave-shell-buffer)'.
If buffer exists but shell process is not running, start new IDL.
If buffer exists and shell process is running, just switch to the buffer.

When called with a prefix ARG, or when `idlwave-shell-use-dedicated-frame'
is non-nil, the shell buffer and the source buffers will be in
separate frames.

The command to run comes from variable `idlwave-shell-explicit-file-name'.

The buffer is put in `idlwave-shell-mode', providing commands for sending
input and controlling the IDL job.  See help on `idlwave-shell-mode'.
See also the variable `idlwave-shell-prompt-pattern'.

(Type \[describe-mode] in the shell buffer for a list of commands.)Fidlwave-mode
Major mode for editing IDL and WAVE CL .pro files.

The main features of this mode are

1. Indentation and Formatting
   --------------------------
   Like other Emacs programming modes, C-j inserts a newline and indents.
   TAB is used for explicit indentation of the current line.

   To start a continuation line, use \[idlwave-split-line].  This function can also
   be used in the middle of a line to split the line at that point.
   When used inside a long constant string, the string is split at
   that point with the `+' concatenation operator.

   Comments are indented as follows:

   `;;;' Indentation remains unchanged.
   `;;'  Indent like the surrounding code
   `;'   Indent to a minimum column.

   The indentation of comments starting in column 0 is never changed.

   Use \[idlwave-fill-paragraph] to refill a paragraph inside a comment.  The indentation
   of the second line of the paragraph relative to the first will be
   retained.  Use \[idlwave-auto-fill-mode] to toggle auto-fill mode for these comments.
   When the variable `idlwave-fill-comment-line-only' is nil, code
   can also be auto-filled and auto-indented (not recommended).

   To convert pre-existing IDL code to your formatting style, mark the
   entire buffer with \[mark-whole-buffer] and execute \[idlwave-expand-region-abbrevs].
   Then mark the entire buffer again followed by \[indent-region] (`indent-region').

2. Routine Info
   ------------
   IDLWAVE displays information about the calling sequence and the accepted
   keyword parameters of a procedure or function with \[idlwave-routine-info].
   \[idlwave-find-module] jumps to the source file of a module.
   These commands know about system routines, all routines in idlwave-mode
   buffers and (when the idlwave-shell is active) about all modules
   currently compiled under this shell.  Use \[idlwave-update-routine-info] to update this
   information, which is also used for completion (see item 4).

3. Online IDL Help
   ---------------
   \[idlwave-context-help] displays the IDL documentation relevant
   for the system variable, keyword, or routine at point.  A single key
   stroke gets you directly to the right place in the docs.  Two additional
   files (an ASCII version of the IDL documentation and a topics file) must
   be installed for this - check the IDLWAVE webpage for these files.

4. Completion
   ----------
   \[idlwave-complete] completes the names of procedures, functions
   class names and keyword parameters.  It is context sensitive and
   figures out what is expected at point (procedure/function/keyword).
   Lower case strings are completed in lower case, other strings in
   mixed or upper case.

5. Code Templates and Abbreviations
   --------------------------------
   Many Abbreviations are predefined to expand to code fragments and templates.
   The abbreviations start generally with a `\`.  Some examples

   \pr        PROCEDURE template
   \fu        FUNCTION template
   \c         CASE statement template
   \sw        SWITCH statement template
   \f         FOR loop template
   \r         REPEAT Loop template
   \w         WHILE loop template
   \i         IF statement template
   \elif      IF-ELSE statement template
   \b         BEGIN
   
   For a full list, use \[idlwave-list-abbrevs].  Some templates also have
   direct keybindings - see the list of keybindings below.

   \[idlwave-doc-header] inserts a documentation header at the beginning of the
   current program unit (pro, function or main).  Change log entries
   can be added to the current program unit with \[idlwave-doc-modification].

6. Automatic Case Conversion
   -------------------------
   The case of reserved words and some abbrevs is controlled by
   `idlwave-reserved-word-upcase' and `idlwave-abbrev-change-case'.

7. Automatic END completion
   ------------------------
   If the variable `idlwave-expand-generic-end' is non-nil, each END typed
   will be converted to the specific version, like ENDIF, ENDFOR, etc.

8. Hooks
   -----
   Loading idlwave.el runs `idlwave-load-hook'.
   Turning on `idlwave-mode' runs `idlwave-mode-hook'.

9. Documentation and Customization
   -------------------------------
   Info documentation for this package is available.  Use \[idlwave-info]
   to display (complain to your sysadmin if that does not work).
   For Postscript and HTML versions of the documentation, check IDLWAVE's
   homepage at `http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~dominik/Tools/idlwave'.
   IDLWAVE has customize support - see the group `idlwave'.

10.Keybindings
   -----------
   Here is a list of all keybindings of this mode.
   If some of the key bindings below show with ??, use \[describe-key]
   followed by the key sequence to see what the key sequence does.

\{idlwave-mode-map}Fielm
Interactively evaluate Emacs Lisp expressions.
Switches to the buffer `*ielm*', or creates it if it does not exist.Fimage-type-from-data
Determine the image type from image data DATA.
Value is a symbol specifying the image type or nil if type cannot
be determined.Fimage-type-from-file-header
Determine the type of image file FILE from its first few bytes.
Value is a symbol specifying the image type, or nil if type cannot
be determined.Fimage-type-available-p
Value is non-nil if image type TYPE is available.
Image types are symbols like `xbm' or `jpeg'.Fcreate-image
Create an image.
FILE-OR-DATA is an image file name or image data.
Optional TYPE is a symbol describing the image type.  If TYPE is omitted
or nil, try to determine the image type from its first few bytes
of image data.  If that doesn't work, and FILE-OR-DATA is a file name,
use its file extension as image type.
Optional DATA-P non-nil means FILE-OR-DATA is a string containing image data.
Optional PROPS are additional image attributes to assign to the image,
like, e.g. `:mask MASK'.
Value is the image created, or nil if images of type TYPE are not supported.Fput-image
Put image IMAGE in front of POS in the current buffer.
IMAGE must be an image created with `create-image' or `defimage'.
IMAGE is displayed by putting an overlay into the current buffer with a
`before-string' STRING that has a `display' property whose value is the
image.  STRING is defaulted if you omit it.
POS may be an integer or marker.
AREA is where to display the image.  AREA nil or omitted means
display it in the text area, a value of `left-margin' means
display it in the left marginal area, a value of `right-margin'
means display it in the right marginal area.Finsert-image
Insert IMAGE into current buffer at point.
IMAGE is displayed by inserting STRING into the current buffer
with a `display' property whose value is the image.  STRING is
defaulted if you omit it.
AREA is where to display the image.  AREA nil or omitted means
display it in the text area, a value of `left-margin' means
display it in the left marginal area, a value of `right-margin'
means display it in the right marginal area.Fremove-images
Remove images between START and END in BUFFER.
Remove only images that were put in BUFFER with calls to `put-image'.
BUFFER nil or omitted means use the current buffer.Ffind-image
Find an image, choosing one of a list of image specifications.

SPECS is a list of image specifications.

Each image specification in SPECS is a property list.  The contents of
a specification are image type dependent.  All specifications must at
least contain the properties `:type TYPE' and either `:file FILE' or
`:data DATA', where TYPE is a symbol specifying the image type,
e.g. `xbm', FILE is the file to load the image from, and DATA is a
string containing the actual image data.  The specification whose TYPE
is supported, and FILE exists, is used to construct the image
specification to be returned.  Return nil if no specification is
satisfied.

The image is looked for first on `load-path' and then in `data-directory'.Fdefimage
Define SYMBOL as an image.

SPECS is a list of image specifications.  DOC is an optional
documentation string.

Each image specification in SPECS is a property list.  The contents of
a specification are image type dependent.  All specifications must at
least contain the properties `:type TYPE' and either `:file FILE' or
`:data DATA', where TYPE is a symbol specifying the image type,
e.g. `xbm', FILE is the file to load the image from, and DATA is a
string containing the actual image data.  The first image
specification whose TYPE is supported, and FILE exists, is used to
define SYMBOL.

Example:

   (defimage test-image ((:type xpm :file "~/test1.xpm")
                         (:type xbm :file "~/test1.xbm")))Vimage-file-name-extensions
*A list of image-file filename extensions.
Filenames having one of these extensions are considered image files,
in addition to those matching `image-file-name-regexps'.

See `auto-image-file-mode'; if `auto-image-file-mode' is enabled,
setting this variable directly does not take effect unless
`auto-image-file-mode' is re-enabled; this happens automatically the
variable is set using \[customize].Vimage-file-name-regexps
*List of regexps matching image-file filenames.
Filenames matching one of these regexps are considered image files,
in addition to those with an extension in `image-file-name-extensions'.

See function `auto-image-file-mode'; if `auto-image-file-mode' is
enabled, setting this variable directly does not take effect unless
`auto-image-file-mode' is re-enabled; this happens automatically the
variable is set using \[customize].Fimage-file-name-regexp
Return a regular expression matching image-file filenames.Finsert-image-file
Insert the image file FILE into the current buffer.
Optional arguments VISIT, BEG, END, and REPLACE are interpreted as for
the command `insert-file-contents'.Vauto-image-file-mode
Non-nil if Auto-Image-File mode is enabled.
See the command `auto-image-file-mode' for a description of this minor-mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `auto-image-file-mode'.Fauto-image-file-mode
Toggle visiting of image files as images.
With prefix argument ARG, turn on if positive, otherwise off.
Returns non-nil if the new state is enabled.

Image files are those whose name has an extension in
`image-file-name-extensions', or matches a regexp in
`image-file-name-regexps'.Vimenu-sort-function
*The function to use for sorting the index mouse-menu.

Affects only the mouse index menu.

Set this to nil if you don't want any sorting (faster).
The items in the menu are then presented in the order they were found
in the buffer.

Set it to `imenu--sort-by-name' if you want alphabetic sorting.

The function should take two arguments and return t if the first
element should come before the second.  The arguments are cons cells;
(NAME . POSITION).  Look at `imenu--sort-by-name' for an example.Vimenu-generic-expression
The regex pattern to use for creating a buffer index.

If non-nil this pattern is passed to `imenu--generic-function'
to create a buffer index.

The value should be an alist with elements that look like this:
 (MENU-TITLE REGEXP INDEX)
or like this:
 (MENU-TITLE REGEXP INDEX FUNCTION ARGUMENTS...)
with zero or more ARGUMENTS.  The former format creates a simple element in
the index alist when it matches; the latter creates a special element
of the form  (NAME POSITION-MARKER FUNCTION ARGUMENTS...)
with FUNCTION and ARGUMENTS copied from `imenu-generic-expression'.

MENU-TITLE is a string used as the title for the submenu or nil if the
entries are not nested.

REGEXP is a regexp that should match a construct in the buffer that is
to be displayed in the menu; i.e., function or variable definitions,
etc.  It contains a substring which is the name to appear in the
menu.  See the info section on Regexps for more information.

INDEX points to the substring in REGEXP that contains the name (of the
function, variable or type) that is to appear in the menu.

The variable is buffer-local.

The variable `imenu-case-fold-search' determines whether or not the
regexp matches are case sensitive, and `imenu-syntax-alist' can be
used to alter the syntax table for the search.

For example, see the value of `lisp-imenu-generic-expression' used by
`fortran-mode' with `imenu-syntax-alist' set locally to give the
characters which normally have "symbol" syntax "word" syntax
during matching.Vimenu-create-index-function
The function to use for creating a buffer index.

It should be a function that takes no arguments and returns an index
of the current buffer as an alist.

Simple elements in the alist look like (INDEX-NAME . INDEX-POSITION).
Special elements look like (INDEX-NAME INDEX-POSITION FUNCTION ARGUMENTS...).
A nested sub-alist element looks like (INDEX-NAME SUB-ALIST).
The function `imenu--subalist-p' tests an element and returns t
if it is a sub-alist.

This function is called within a `save-excursion'.

The variable is buffer-local.Vimenu-prev-index-position-function
Function for finding the next index position.

If `imenu-create-index-function' is set to
`imenu-default-create-index-function', then you must set this variable
to a function that will find the next index, looking backwards in the
file.

The function should leave point at the place to be connected to the
index and it should return nil when it doesn't find another index.

This variable is local in all buffers.Vimenu-extract-index-name-function
Function for extracting the index item name, given a position.

This function is called after `imenu-prev-index-position-function'
finds a position for an index item, with point at that position.
It should return the name for that index item.

This variable is local in all buffers.Vimenu-name-lookup-function
Function to compare string with index item.

This function will be called with two strings, and should return
non-nil if they match.

If nil, comparison is done with `string='.
Set this to some other function for more advanced comparisons,
such as "begins with" or "name matches and number of
arguments match".

This variable is local in all buffers.Vimenu-default-goto-function
The default function called when selecting an Imenu item.
The function in this variable is called when selecting a normal index-item.Fimenu-add-to-menubar
Add an `imenu' entry to the menu bar for the current buffer.
NAME is a string used to name the menu bar item.
See the command `imenu' for more information.Fimenu-add-menubar-index
Add an Imenu "Index" entry on the menu bar for the current buffer.

A trivial interface to `imenu-add-to-menubar' suitable for use in a hook.Fimenu
Jump to a place in the buffer chosen using a buffer menu or mouse menu.
INDEX-ITEM specifies the position.  See `imenu-choose-buffer-index'
for more information.Vinferior-lisp-filter-regexp
*What not to save on inferior Lisp's input history.
Input matching this regexp is not saved on the input history in Inferior Lisp
mode.  Default is whitespace followed by 0 or 1 single-letter colon-keyword
(as in :a, :c, etc.)Vinferior-lisp-program
*Program name for invoking an inferior Lisp with for Inferior Lisp mode.Vinferior-lisp-load-command
*Format-string for building a Lisp expression to load a file.
This format string should use `%s' to substitute a file name
and should result in a Lisp expression that will command the inferior Lisp
to load that file.  The default works acceptably on most Lisps.
The string "(progn (load \"%s\" :verbose nil :print t) (values))\n"
produces cosmetically superior output for this application,
but it works only in Common Lisp.Vinferior-lisp-prompt
Regexp to recognise prompts in the Inferior Lisp mode.
Defaults to "^[^> \n]*>+:? *", which works pretty good for Lucid, kcl,
and franz.  This variable is used to initialize `comint-prompt-regexp' in the
Inferior Lisp buffer.

This variable is only used if the variable
`comint-use-prompt-regexp-instead-of-fields' is non-nil.

More precise choices:
Lucid Common Lisp: "^\\(>\\|\\(->\\)+\\) *"
franz: "^\\(->\\|<[0-9]*>:\\) *"
kcl: "^>+ *"

This is a fine thing to set in your .emacs file.Vinferior-lisp-mode-hook
*Hook for customising Inferior Lisp mode.Finferior-lisp
Run an inferior Lisp process, input and output via buffer `*inferior-lisp*'.
If there is a process already running in `*inferior-lisp*', just switch
to that buffer.
With argument, allows you to edit the command line (default is value
of `inferior-lisp-program').  Runs the hooks from
`inferior-lisp-mode-hook' (after the `comint-mode-hook' is run).
(Type \[describe-mode] in the process buffer for a list of commands.)Finfo-other-window
Like `info' but show the Info buffer in another window.Finfo
Enter Info, the documentation browser.
Optional argument FILE specifies the file to examine;
the default is the top-level directory of Info.
Called from a program, FILE may specify an Info node of the form
`(FILENAME)NODENAME'.

In interactive use, a prefix argument directs this command
to read a file name from the minibuffer.

The search path for Info files is in the variable `Info-directory-list'.
The top-level Info directory is made by combining all the files named `dir'
in all the directories in that path.Finfo-standalone
Run Emacs as a standalone Info reader.
Usage:  emacs -f info-standalone [filename]
In standalone mode, \<Info-mode-map>\[Info-exit] exits Emacs itself.FInfo-directory
Go to the Info directory node.FInfo-goto-emacs-command-node
Go to the Info node in the Emacs manual for command COMMAND.
The command is found by looking up in Emacs manual's indices
or in another manual found via COMMAND's `info-file' property or
the variable `Info-file-list-for-emacs'.FInfo-goto-emacs-key-command-node
Go to the node in the Emacs manual which describes the command bound to KEY.
KEY is a string.
Interactively, if the binding is `execute-extended-command', a command is read.
The command is found by looking up in Emacs manual's indices
or in another manual found via COMMAND's `info-file' property or
the variable `Info-file-list-for-emacs'.FInfo-speedbar-browser
Initialize speedbar to display an info node browser.
This will add a speedbar major display mode.Finfo-lookup-reset
Throw away all cached data.
This command is useful if the user wants to start at the beginning without
quitting Emacs, for example, after some Info documents were updated on the
system.Finfo-lookup-symbol
Display the definition of SYMBOL, as found in the relevant manual.
When this command is called interactively, it reads SYMBOL from the minibuffer.
In the minibuffer, use M-n to yank the default argument value
into the minibuffer so you can edit it.
The default symbol is the one found at point.

With prefix arg a query for the symbol help mode is offered.Finfo-lookup-file
Display the documentation of a file.
When this command is called interactively, it reads FILE from the minibuffer.
In the minibuffer, use M-n to yank the default file name
into the minibuffer so you can edit it.
The default file name is the one found at point.

With prefix arg a query for the file help mode is offered.Finfo-complete-symbol
Perform completion on symbol preceding point.Finfo-complete-file
Perform completion on file preceding point.FInfo-tagify
Create or update Info file tag table in current buffer or in a region.FInfo-split
Split an info file into an indirect file plus bounded-size subfiles.
Each subfile will be up to 50,000 characters plus one node.

To use this command, first visit a large Info file that has a tag
table.  The buffer is modified into a (small) indirect info file which
should be saved in place of the original visited file.

The subfiles are written in the same directory the original file is
in, with names generated by appending `-' and a number to the original
file name.  The indirect file still functions as an Info file, but it
contains just the tag table and a directory of subfiles.FInfo-validate
Check current buffer for validity as an Info file.
Check that every node pointer points to an existing node.Fbatch-info-validate
Runs `Info-validate' on the files remaining on the command line.
Must be used only with -batch, and kills Emacs on completion.
Each file will be processed even if an error occurred previously.
For example, invoke "emacs -batch -f batch-info-validate $info/ ~/*.info"Fisearch-toggle-specified-input-method
Select an input method and turn it on in interactive search.Fisearch-toggle-input-method
Toggle input method in interactive search.Fiso-accents-mode
Toggle ISO Accents mode, in which accents modify the following letter.
This permits easy insertion of accented characters according to ISO-8859-1.
When Iso-accents mode is enabled, accent character keys
(`, ', ", ^, / and ~) do not self-insert; instead, they modify the following
letter key so that it inserts an ISO accented letter.

You can customize ISO Accents mode to a particular language
with the command `iso-accents-customize'.

Special combinations: ~c gives a c with cedilla,
~d gives an Icelandic eth (d with dash).
~t gives an Icelandic thorn.
"s gives German sharp s.
/a gives a with ring.
/e gives an a-e ligature.
~< and ~> give guillemots.
~! gives an inverted exclamation mark.
~? gives an inverted question mark.

With an argument, a positive argument enables ISO Accents mode, 
and a negative argument disables it.Fiso-spanish
Translate net conventions for Spanish to ISO 8859-1.
The region between FROM and TO is translated using the table TRANS-TAB.
Optional arg BUFFER is ignored (for use in `format-alist').Fiso-german

*File name of your personal spelling dictionary, or nil.
If nil, the default personal dictionary, "~/.ispell_DICTNAME" is used,
where DICTNAME is the name of your default dictionary.Vispell-local-dictionary-alist
*Contains local or customized dictionary definitions.
See `ispell-dictionary-alist'.Vispell-dictionary-alist
An alist of dictionaries and their associated parameters.

Each element of this list is also a list:

(DICTIONARY-NAME CASECHARS NOT-CASECHARS OTHERCHARS MANY-OTHERCHARS-P
        ISPELL-ARGS EXTENDED-CHARACTER-MODE CHARACTER-SET)

DICTIONARY-NAME is a possible string value of variable `ispell-dictionary',
nil means the default dictionary.

CASECHARS is a regular expression of valid characters that comprise a
word.

NOT-CASECHARS is the opposite regexp of CASECHARS.

OTHERCHARS is a regexp of characters in the NOT-CASECHARS set but which can be
used to construct words in some special way.  If OTHERCHARS characters follow
and precede characters from CASECHARS, they are parsed as part of a word,
otherwise they become word-breaks.  As an example in English, assume the
regular expression "[']" for OTHERCHARS.  Then "they're" and
"Steven's" are parsed as single words including the "'" character, but
"Stevens'" does not include the quote character as part of the word.
If you want OTHERCHARS to be empty, use the empty string.
Hint: regexp syntax requires the hyphen to be declared first here.

MANY-OTHERCHARS-P is non-nil when multiple OTHERCHARS are allowed in a word.
Otherwise only a single OTHERCHARS character is allowed to be part of any
single word.

ISPELL-ARGS is a list of additional arguments passed to the ispell
subprocess.

EXTENDED-CHARACTER-MODE should be used when dictionaries are used which
have been configured in an Ispell affix file.  (For example, umlauts
can be encoded as \"a, a\", "a, ...)  Defaults are ~tex and ~nroff
in English.  This has the same effect as the command-line `-T' option.
The buffer Major Mode controls Ispell's parsing in tex or nroff mode,
but the dictionary can control the extended character mode.
Both defaults can be overruled in a buffer-local fashion. See
`ispell-parsing-keyword' for details on this.

CHARACTER-SET used for languages with multibyte characters.

Note that the CASECHARS and OTHERCHARS slots of the alist should
contain the same character set as casechars and otherchars in the
LANGUAGE.aff file (e.g., english.aff).Vispell-menu-map
Key map for ispell menu.Vispell-menu-xemacs
Spelling menu for XEmacs.
If nil when package is loaded, a standard menu will be set,
and added as a submenu of the "Edit" menu.Vispell-skip-region-alist
Alist expressing beginning and end of regions not to spell check.
The alist key must be a regular expression.
Valid forms include:
  (KEY) - just skip the key.
  (KEY . REGEXP) - skip to the end of REGEXP.  REGEXP may be string or symbol.
  (KEY REGEXP) - skip to end of REGEXP.  REGEXP must be a string.
  (KEY FUNCTION ARGS) - FUNCTION called with ARGS returns end of region.Vispell-tex-skip-alists
*Lists of regions to be skipped in TeX mode.
First list is used raw.
Second list has key placed inside \begin{}.

Delete or add any regions you want to be automatically selected
for skipping in latex mode.Fispell-word
Check spelling of word under or before the cursor.
If the word is not found in dictionary, display possible corrections
in a window allowing you to choose one.

If optional argument FOLLOWING is non-nil or if `ispell-following-word'
is non-nil when called interactively, then the following word
(rather than preceding) is checked when the cursor is not over a word.
When the optional argument QUIETLY is non-nil or `ispell-quietly' is non-nil
when called interactively, non-corrective messages are suppressed.

With a prefix argument (or if CONTINUE is non-nil),
resume interrupted spell-checking of a buffer or region.

Word syntax described by `ispell-dictionary-alist' (which see).

This will check or reload the dictionary.  Use \[ispell-change-dictionary]
or \[ispell-region] to update the Ispell process.

return values:
nil           word is correct or spelling is accpeted.
0             word is inserted into buffer-local definitions.
"word"        word corrected from word list.
("word" arg)  word is hand entered.
quit          spell session exited.Fispell-pdict-save
Check to see if the personal dictionary has been modified.
If so, ask if it needs to be saved.Fispell-help
Display a list of the options available when a misspelling is encountered.

Selections are:

DIGIT: Replace the word with a digit offered in the *Choices* buffer.
SPC:   Accept word this time.
`i':   Accept word and insert into private dictionary.
`a':   Accept word for this session.
`A':   Accept word and place in `buffer-local dictionary'.
`r':   Replace word with typed-in value.  Rechecked.
`R':   Replace word with typed-in value. Query-replaced in buffer. Rechecked.
`?':   Show these commands.
`x':   Exit spelling buffer.  Move cursor to original point.
`X':   Exit spelling buffer.  Leaves cursor at the current point, and permits
        the aborted check to be completed later.
`q':   Quit spelling session (Kills ispell process).
`l':   Look up typed-in replacement in alternate dictionary.  Wildcards okay.
`u':   Like `i', but the word is lower-cased first.
`m':   Place typed-in value in personal dictionary, then recheck current word.
`C-l':  redraws screen
`C-r':  recursive edit
`C-z':  suspend emacs or iconify frameFispell-kill-ispell
Kill current Ispell process (so that you may start a fresh one).
With NO-ERROR, just return non-nil if there was no Ispell running.Fispell-change-dictionary
Change `ispell-dictionary' (q.v.) to DICT and kill old Ispell process.
A new one will be started as soon as necessary.

By just answering RET you can find out what the current dictionary is.

With prefix argument, set the default dictionary.Fispell-region
Interactively check a region for spelling errors.
Return nil if spell session is quit,
 otherwise returns shift offset amount for last line processed.Fispell-comments-and-strings
Check comments and strings in the current buffer for spelling errors.Fispell-buffer
Check the current buffer for spelling errors interactively.Fispell-continue
Continue a halted spelling session beginning with the current word.Fispell-complete-word
Try to complete the word before or under point (see `lookup-words')
If optional INTERIOR-FRAG is non-nil then the word may be a character
sequence inside of a word.

Standard ispell choices are then available.Fispell-complete-word-interior-frag
Completes word matching character sequence inside a word.Fispell
Interactively check a region or buffer for spelling errors.
If `transient-mark-mode' is on, and a region is active, spell-check
that region.  Otherwise spell-check the buffer.

Ispell dictionaries are not distributed with Emacs.  If you are
looking for a dictionary, please see the distribution of the GNU ispell
program, or do an Internet search; there are various dictionaries
available on the net.Fispell-minor-mode
Toggle Ispell minor mode.
With prefix arg, turn Ispell minor mode on iff arg is positive.

In Ispell minor mode, pressing SPC or RET
warns you if the previous word is incorrectly spelled.

All the buffer-local variables and dictionaries are ignored -- to read
them into the running ispell process, type \[ispell-word] SPC.Fispell-message
Check the spelling of a mail message or news post.
Don't check spelling of message headers except the Subject field.
Don't check included messages.

To abort spell checking of a message region and send the message anyway,
use the `x' command.  (Any subsequent regions will be checked.)
The `X' command aborts the message send so that you can edit the buffer.

To spell-check whenever a message is sent, include the appropriate lines
in your .emacs file:
   (add-hook 'message-send-hook 'ispell-message)  ;; GNUS 5
   (add-hook 'news-inews-hook 'ispell-message)    ;; GNUS 4
   (add-hook 'mail-send-hook  'ispell-message)
   (add-hook 'mh-before-send-letter-hook 'ispell-message)

You can bind this to the key C-c i in GNUS or mail by adding to
`news-reply-mode-hook' or `mail-mode-hook' the following lambda expression:
   (function (lambda () (local-set-key "\C-ci" 'ispell-message)))Viswitchb-mode
Toggle Iswitchb mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `iswitchb-mode'.Fiswitchb-read-buffer
Replacement for the built-in `read-buffer'.
Return the name of a buffer selected.
PROMPT is the prompt to give to the user.  DEFAULT if given is the default
buffer to be selected, which will go to the front of the list.
If REQUIRE-MATCH is non-nil, an existing-buffer must be selected.Fiswitchb-default-keybindings
Set up default keybindings for `iswitchb-buffer'.
Call this function to override the normal bindings.  This function also
adds a hook to the minibuffer.

Obsolescent.  Use `iswitchb-mode'.Fiswitchb-buffer

The buffer name is selected interactively by typing a substring.  The
buffer is displayed according to `iswitchb-default-method' -- the
default is to show it in the same window, unless it is already visible
in another frame.
For details of keybindings, do `\[describe-function] iswitchb'.Fiswitchb-buffer-other-window
Switch to another buffer and show it in another window.
The buffer name is selected interactively by typing a substring.
For details of keybindings, do `\[describe-function] iswitchb'.Fiswitchb-display-buffer

The buffer name is selected interactively by typing a substring.
For details of keybindings, do `\[describe-function] iswitchb'.Fiswitchb-buffer-other-frame
Switch to another buffer and show it in another frame.
The buffer name is selected interactively by typing a substring.
For details of keybindings, do `\[describe-function] iswitchb'.Fiswitchb-mode
Toggle Iswitchb global minor mode.
With arg, turn Iswitchb mode on if and only iff ARG is positive.
This mode enables switching between buffers using substrings.  See
`iswitchb' for details.Fjapanese-katakana
Convert argument to Katakana and return that.
The argument may be a character or string.  The result has the same type.
The argument object is not altered--the value is a copy.
Optional argument HANKAKU t means to convert to `hankaku' Katakana
 (`japanese-jisx0201-kana'), in which case return value
 may be a string even if OBJ is a character if two Katakanas are
 necessary to represent OBJ.Fjapanese-hiragana
Convert argument to Hiragana and return that.
The argument may be a character or string.  The result has the same type.
The argument object is not altered--the value is a copy.Fjapanese-hankaku

Optional argument KATAKANA-ONLY non-nil means to convert only KATAKANA char.Fread-hiragana-string
Read a Hiragana string from the minibuffer, prompting with string PROMPT.
If non-nil, second arg INITIAL-INPUT is a string to insert before reading.Fjit-lock-register
Register FUN as a fontification function to be called in this buffer.
FUN will be called with two arguments START and END indicating the region
that needs to be (re)fontified.
If non-nil, CONTEXTUAL means that a contextual fontification would be useful.Vauto-compression-mode
Non-nil if Auto-Compression mode is enabled.
See the command `auto-compression-mode' for a description of this minor-mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `auto-compression-mode'.Fauto-compression-mode
Toggle automatic file compression and uncompression.
With prefix argument ARG, turn auto compression on if positive, else off.
Returns the new status of auto compression (non-nil means on).Fwith-auto-compression-mode
Evalute BODY with automatic file compression and uncompression enabled.Fkinsoku
Go to a line breaking position near point by doing `kinsoku' processing.
LINEBEG is a buffer position we can't break a line before.

`Kinsoku' processing is to prohibit specific characters to be placed
at beginning of line or at end of line.  Characters not to be placed
at beginning and end of line have character category `>' and `<'
respectively.  This restriction is dissolved by making a line longer or
shorter.

`Kinsoku' is a Japanese word which originally means ordering to stay
in one place, and is used for the text processing described above in
the context of text formatting.Vkkc-after-update-conversion-functions
Functions to run after a conversion is selected in `japanese' input method.
With this input method, a user can select a proper conversion from
candidate list.  Each time he changes the selection, functions in this
list are called with two arguments; starting and ending buffer
positions that contains the current selection.Fkkc-region

Users can select a desirable conversion interactively.
When called from a program, expects two arguments,
positions FROM and TO (integers or markers) specifying the target region.
When it returns, the point is at the tail of the selected conversion,
and the return value is the length of the conversion.Vdefault-korean-keyboard

If a game is in progress, this command allows you to resume it.
Here is the relation between prefix args and game options:

prefix arg | robot is auto-started | weights are saved from last game
---------------------------------------------------------------------
none / 1   | yes                   | no
       2   | yes                   | yes
       3   | no                    | yes
       4   | no                    | no

You start by moving to a square and typing \[lm-start-robot],
if you did not use a prefix arg to ask for automatic start.
Use \[describe-mode] for more info.Flao-transcribe-single-roman-syllable-to-lao
Transcribe a Romanized Lao syllable in the region FROM and TO to Lao string.
Only the first syllable is transcribed.
The value has the form: (START END LAO-STRING), where
START and END are the beggining and end positions of the Roman Lao syllable,
LAO-STRING is the Lao character transcription of it.

Optional 3rd arg STR, if non-nil, is a string to search for Roman Lao
syllable.  In that case, FROM and TO are indexes to STR.Flao-transcribe-roman-to-lao-string
Transcribe Romanized Lao string STR to Lao character string.Flao-composition-function
Compose Lao text in the region FROM and TO.
The text matches the regular expression PATTERN.
Optional 4th argument STRING, if non-nil, is a string containing text
to compose.

The return value is number of composed characters.Vlatin1-display
Set up Latin-1/ASCII display for ISO8859 character sets.
This is done for each character set in the list `latin1-display-sets',
if no font is available to display it.  Characters are displayed using
the corresponding Latin-1 characters where they match.  Otherwise
ASCII sequences are used, mostly following the Latin prefix input
methods.  Some different ASCII sequences are used if
`latin1-display-mnemonic' is non-nil.

Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either M-x customize of the function `latin1-display'.Flatin1-display
Set up Latin-1/ASCII display for the arguments character SETS.
See option `latin1-display' for the method.  The members of the list
must be in `latin1-display-sets'.  With no arguments, reset the
display for all of `latin1-display-sets'. See also `latin1-display-setup'.Flazy-lock-mode
Toggle Lazy Lock mode.
With arg, turn Lazy Lock mode on if and only if arg is positive.  Enable it
automatically in your `~/.emacs' by:

 (setq font-lock-support-mode 'lazy-lock-mode)

When Lazy Lock mode is enabled, fontification can be lazy in a number of ways:

- Demand-driven buffer fontification if `lazy-lock-minimum-size' is non-nil.
  This means initial fontification does not occur if the buffer is greater than
  `lazy-lock-minimum-size' characters in length.  Instead, fontification occurs
  when necessary, such as when scrolling through the buffer would otherwise
  reveal unfontified areas.  This is useful if buffer fontification is too slow
  for large buffers.

- Deferred scroll fontification if `lazy-lock-defer-on-scrolling' is non-nil.
  This means demand-driven fontification does not occur as you scroll.
  Instead, fontification is deferred until after `lazy-lock-defer-time' seconds
  of Emacs idle time, while Emacs remains idle.  This is useful if
  fontification is too slow to keep up with scrolling.

- Deferred on-the-fly fontification if `lazy-lock-defer-on-the-fly' is non-nil.
  This means on-the-fly fontification does not occur as you type.  Instead,
  fontification is deferred until after `lazy-lock-defer-time' seconds of Emacs
  idle time, while Emacs remains idle.  This is useful if fontification is too
  slow to keep up with your typing.

- Deferred context fontification if `lazy-lock-defer-contextually' is non-nil.
  This means fontification updates the buffer corresponding to true syntactic
  context, after `lazy-lock-defer-time' seconds of Emacs idle time, while Emacs
  remains idle.  Otherwise, fontification occurs on modified lines only, and
  subsequent lines can remain fontified corresponding to previous syntactic
  contexts.  This is useful where strings or comments span lines.

- Stealthy buffer fontification if `lazy-lock-stealth-time' is non-nil.
  This means remaining unfontified areas of buffers are fontified if Emacs has
  been idle for `lazy-lock-stealth-time' seconds, while Emacs remains idle.
  This is useful if any buffer has any deferred fontification.

Basic Font Lock mode on-the-fly fontification behaviour fontifies modified
lines only.  Thus, if `lazy-lock-defer-contextually' is non-nil, Lazy Lock mode
on-the-fly fontification may fontify differently, albeit correctly.  In any
event, to refontify some lines you can use \[font-lock-fontify-block].

Stealth fontification only occurs while the system remains unloaded.
If the system load rises above `lazy-lock-stealth-load' percent, stealth
fontification is suspended.  Stealth fontification intensity is controlled via
the variable `lazy-lock-stealth-nice' and `lazy-lock-stealth-lines', and
verbosity is controlled via the variable `lazy-lock-stealth-verbose'.Fturn-on-lazy-lock
Unconditionally turn on Lazy Lock mode.Vledit-save-files
*Non-nil means Ledit should save files before transferring to Lisp.Vledit-go-to-lisp-string
*Shell commands to execute to resume Lisp job.Vledit-go-to-liszt-string
*Shell commands to execute to resume Lisp compiler job.Fledit-mode
\<ledit-mode-map>Major mode for editing text and stuffing it to a Lisp job.
Like Lisp mode, plus these special commands:
  \[ledit-save-defun]	-- record defun at or after point
	   for later transmission to Lisp job.
  \[ledit-save-region] -- record region for later transmission to Lisp job.
  \[ledit-go-to-lisp] -- transfer to Lisp job and transmit saved text.
  \[ledit-go-to-liszt] -- transfer to Liszt (Lisp compiler) job
	   and transmit saved text.
\{ledit-mode-map}
To make Lisp mode automatically change to Ledit mode,
do (setq lisp-mode-hook 'ledit-from-lisp-mode)Flife
Run Conway's Life simulation.
The starting pattern is randomly selected.  Prefix arg (optional first
arg non-nil from a program) is the number of seconds to sleep between
generations (this defaults to 1).Funload-feature
Unload the library that provided FEATURE, restoring all its autoloads.
If the feature is required by any other loaded code, and prefix arg FORCE
is nil, raise an error.Flocate
Run the program `locate', putting results in `*Locate*' buffer.
With prefix arg, prompt for the locate command to run.Flocate-with-filter
Run the locate command with a filter.

The filter is a regular expression. Only results matching the filter are
shown; this is often useful to constrain a big search.Flog-edit
Setup a buffer to enter a log message.
\<log-edit-mode-map>The buffer will be put in `log-edit-mode'.
If SETUP is non-nil, the buffer is then erased and `log-edit-hook' is run.
Mark and point will be set around the entire contents of the
buffer so that it is easy to kill the contents of the buffer with \[kill-region].
Once you're done editing the message, pressing \[log-edit-done] will call
`log-edit-done' which will end up calling CALLBACK to do the actual commit.
LISTFUN if non-nil is a function of no arguments returning the list of files
  that are concerned by the current operation (using relative names).
If BUFFER is non-nil `log-edit' will jump to that buffer, use it to edit the
  log message and go back to the current buffer when done.  Otherwise, it
  uses the current buffer.Flog-view-mode
Major mode for browsing CVS log output.Vprinter-name
*The name of a local printer to which data is sent for printing.
(Note that PostScript files are sent to `ps-printer-name', which see.)

On Unix-like systems, a string value should be a name understood by
lpr's -P option; otherwise the value should be nil.

On MS-DOS and MS-Windows systems, a string value is taken as the name of
a printer device or port, provided `lpr-command' is set to "".
Typical non-default settings would be "LPT1" to "LPT3" for parallel
printers, or "COM1" to "COM4" or "AUX" for serial printers, or
"//hostname/printer" for a shared network printer.  You can also set
it to the name of a file, in which case the output gets appended to that
file.  If you want to discard the printed output, set this to "NUL".Vlpr-switches
*List of strings to pass as extra options for the printer program.
It is recommended to set `printer-name' instead of including an explicit
switch on this list.
See `lpr-command'.Vlpr-command
*Name of program for printing a file.

On MS-DOS and MS-Windows systems, if the value is an empty string then
Emacs will write directly to the printer port named by `printer-name'.
The programs `print' and `nprint' (the standard print programs on
Windows NT and Novell Netware respectively) are handled specially, using
`printer-name' as the destination for output; any other program is
treated like `lpr' except that an explicit filename is given as the last
argument.Flpr-buffer
Print buffer contents without pagination or page headers.
See the variables `lpr-switches' and `lpr-command'
for customization of the printer command.Fprint-buffer
Paginate and print buffer contents.

The variable `lpr-headers-switches' controls how to paginate.
If it is nil (the default), we run the `pr' program (or whatever program
`lpr-page-header-program' specifies) to paginate.
`lpr-page-header-switches' specifies the switches for that program.

Otherwise, the switches in `lpr-headers-switches' are used
in the print command itself; we expect them to request pagination.
 
See the variables `lpr-switches' and `lpr-command'
for further customization of the printer command.Flpr-region
Print region contents without pagination or page headers.
See the variables `lpr-switches' and `lpr-command'
for customization of the printer command.Fprint-region
Paginate and print the region contents.

The variable `lpr-headers-switches' controls how to paginate.
If it is nil (the default), we run the `pr' program (or whatever program
`lpr-page-header-program' specifies) to paginate.
`lpr-page-header-switches' specifies the switches for that program.

Otherwise, the switches in `lpr-headers-switches' are used
in the print command itself; we expect them to request pagination.
 
See the variables `lpr-switches' and `lpr-command'
for further customization of the printer command.Fphases-of-moon
Display the quarters of the moon for last month, this month, and next month.
If called with an optional prefix argument, prompts for month and year.

This function is suitable for execution in a .emacs file.Fm4-mode
A major mode to edit m4 macro files.
\{m4-mode-map}
Fname-last-kbd-macro
Assign a name to the last keyboard macro defined.
Argument SYMBOL is the name to define.
The symbol's function definition becomes the keyboard macro string.
Such a "function" cannot be called from Lisp, but it is a valid editor command.Finsert-kbd-macro
Insert in buffer the definition of kbd macro NAME, as Lisp code.
Optional second arg KEYS means also record the keys it is on
(this is the prefix argument, when calling interactively).

This Lisp code will, when executed, define the kbd macro with the same
definition it has now.  If you say to record the keys, the Lisp code
will also rebind those keys to the macro.  Only global key bindings
are recorded since executing this Lisp code always makes global
bindings.

To save a kbd macro, visit a file of Lisp code such as your `~/.emacs',
use this command, and then save the file.Fkbd-macro-query
Query user during kbd macro execution.
  With prefix argument, enters recursive edit, reading keyboard
commands even within a kbd macro.  You can give different commands
each time the macro executes.
  Without prefix argument, asks whether to continue running the macro.
Your options are: \<query-replace-map>
\[act]	Finish this iteration normally and continue with the next.
\[skip]	Skip the rest of this iteration, and start the next.
\[exit]	Stop the macro entirely right now.
\[recenter]	Redisplay the screen, then ask again.
\[edit]	Enter recursive edit; ask again when you exit from that.Fapply-macro-to-region-lines
For each complete line between point and mark, move to the beginning
of the line, and run the last keyboard macro.

When called from lisp, this function takes two arguments TOP and
BOTTOM, describing the current region.  TOP must be before BOTTOM.
The optional third argument MACRO specifies a keyboard macro to
execute.

This is useful for quoting or unquoting included text, adding and
removing comments, or producing tables where the entries are regular.

For example, in Usenet articles, sections of text quoted from another
author are indented, or have each line start with `>'.  To quote a
section of text, define a keyboard macro which inserts `>', put point
and mark at opposite ends of the quoted section, and use
`\[apply-macro-to-region-lines]' to mark the entire section.

Suppose you wanted to build a keyword table in C where each entry
looked like this:

    { "foo", foo_data, foo_function }, 
    { "bar", bar_data, bar_function },
    { "baz", baz_data, baz_function },

You could enter the names in this format:

    foo
    bar
    baz

and write a macro to massage a word into a table entry:

    \C-x (
       \M-d { "\C-y", \C-y_data, \C-y_function },
    \C-x )

and then select the region of un-tablified names and use
`\[apply-macro-to-region-lines]' to build the table from the names.
Fmail-extract-address-components
Given an RFC-822 address ADDRESS, extract full name and canonical address.
Returns a list of the form (FULL-NAME CANONICAL-ADDRESS).
If no name can be extracted, FULL-NAME will be nil.

If the optional argument ALL is non-nil, then ADDRESS can contain zero
or more recipients, separated by commas, and we return a list of
the form ((FULL-NAME CANONICAL-ADDRESS) ...) with one element for
each recipient.  If ALL is nil, then if ADDRESS contains more than
one recipients, all but the first is ignored.

ADDRESS may be a string or a buffer.  If it is a buffer, the visible
 (narrowed) portion of the buffer will be interpreted as the address.
 (This feature exists so that the clever caller might be able to avoid
 consing a string.)Fwhat-domain
Convert mail domain DOMAIN to the country it corresponds to.Fmail-hist-define-keys
Define keys for accessing mail header history.  For use in hooks.Vmail-hist-keep-history
*Non-nil means keep a history for headers and text of outgoing mail.Fmail-hist-put-headers-into-history
Put headers and contents of this message into mail header history. 
Each header has its own independent history, as does the body of the
message.

This function normally would be called when the message is sent.Vmail-use-rfc822
*If non-nil, use a full, hairy RFC822 parser on mail addresses.
Otherwise, (the default) use a smaller, somewhat faster, and
often correct parser.Fmail-quote-printable
Convert a string to the "quoted printable" Q encoding.
If the optional argument WRAPPER is non-nil,
we add the wrapper characters =?ISO-8859-1?Q?....?=.Fmail-unquote-printable
Undo the "quoted printable" encoding.
If the optional argument WRAPPER is non-nil,
we expect to find and remove the wrapper characters =?ISO-8859-1?Q?....?=.Fmail-unquote-printable-region
Undo the "quoted printable" encoding in buffer from BEG to END.
If the optional argument WRAPPER is non-nil,
we expect to find and remove the wrapper characters =?ISO-8859-1?Q?....?=.Fmail-fetch-field
Return the value of the header field whose type is FIELD-NAME.
The buffer is expected to be narrowed to just the header of the message.
If second arg LAST is non-nil, use the last field of type FIELD-NAME.
If third arg ALL is non-nil, concatenate all such fields with commas between.
If 4th arg LIST is non-nil, return a list of all such fields.Fmail-abbrevs-setup
Initialize use of the `mailabbrev' package.Fbuild-mail-abbrevs
Read mail aliases from personal mail alias file and set `mail-abbrevs'.
By default this is the file specified by `mail-personal-alias-file'.Fdefine-mail-abbrev
Define NAME as a mail alias abbrev that translates to DEFINITION.
If DEFINITION contains multiple addresses, separate them with commas.Vmail-complete-style
*Specifies how \[mail-complete] formats the full name when it completes.
If `nil', they contain just the return address like:
	king@grassland.com
If `parens', they look like:
	king@grassland.com (Elvis Parsley)
If `angles', they look like:
	Elvis Parsley <king@grassland.com>Fexpand-mail-aliases
Expand all mail aliases in suitable header fields found between BEG and END.
If interactive, expand in header fields.
Suitable header fields are `To', `From', `CC' and `BCC', `Reply-to', and
their `Resent-' variants.

Optional second arg EXCLUDE may be a regular expression defining text to be
removed from alias expansions.Fdefine-mail-alias
Define NAME as a mail alias that translates to DEFINITION.
This means that sending a message to NAME will actually send to DEFINITION.

Normally, the addresses in DEFINITION must be separated by commas.
If FROM-MAILRC-FILE is non-nil, then addresses in DEFINITION 
can be separated by spaces; an address can contain spaces
if it is quoted with double-quotes.Fmail-complete
Perform completion on header field or word preceding point.
Completable headers are according to `mail-complete-alist'.  If none matches
current header, calls `mail-complete-function' and passes prefix arg if any.Fmakefile-mode
Major mode for editing Makefiles.
This function ends by invoking the function(s) `makefile-mode-hook'.

\{makefile-mode-map}

In the browser, use the following keys:

\{makefile-browser-map}

Makefile mode can be configured by modifying the following variables:

makefile-browser-buffer-name:
    Name of the macro- and target browser buffer.

makefile-target-colon:
    The string that gets appended to all target names
    inserted by `makefile-insert-target'.
    ":" or "::" are quite common values.

makefile-macro-assign:
   The string that gets appended to all macro names
   inserted by `makefile-insert-macro'.
   The normal value should be " = ", since this is what
   standard make expects.  However, newer makes such as dmake
   allow a larger variety of different macro assignments, so you
   might prefer to use " += " or " := " .

makefile-tab-after-target-colon:
   If you want a TAB (instead of a space) to be appended after the
   target colon, then set this to a non-nil value.

makefile-browser-leftmost-column:
   Number of blanks to the left of the browser selection mark.

makefile-browser-cursor-column:
   Column in which the cursor is positioned when it moves
   up or down in the browser.

makefile-browser-selected-mark:
   String used to mark selected entries in the browser.

makefile-browser-unselected-mark:
   String used to mark unselected entries in the browser.

makefile-browser-auto-advance-after-selection-p:
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value the cursor
   will automagically advance to the next line after an item
   has been selected in the browser.

makefile-pickup-everything-picks-up-filenames-p:
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value then
   `makefile-pickup-everything' also picks up filenames as targets
   (i.e. it calls `makefile-pickup-filenames-as-targets'), otherwise
   filenames are omitted.

makefile-cleanup-continuations-p:
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value then Makefile mode
   will assure that no line in the file ends with a backslash
   (the continuation character) followed by any whitespace.
   This is done by silently removing the trailing whitespace, leaving
   the backslash itself intact.
   IMPORTANT: Please note that enabling this option causes Makefile mode
   to MODIFY A FILE WITHOUT YOUR CONFIRMATION when "it seems necessary".

makefile-browser-hook:
   A function or list of functions to be called just before the
   browser is entered. This is executed in the makefile buffer.

makefile-special-targets-list:
   List of special targets. You will be offered to complete
   on one of those in the minibuffer whenever you enter a `.'.
   at the beginning of a line in Makefile mode.Fmake-command-summary
Make a summary of current key bindings in the buffer *Summary*.
Previous contents of that buffer are killed first.Fman
Get a Un*x manual page and put it in a buffer.
This command is the top-level command in the man package.  It runs a Un*x
command to retrieve and clean a manpage in the background and places the
results in a Man mode (manpage browsing) buffer.  See variable
`Man-notify-method' for what happens when the buffer is ready.
If a buffer already exists for this man page, it will display immediately.

To specify a man page from a certain section, type SUBJECT(SECTION) or
SECTION SUBJECT when prompted for a manual entry.  To see manpages from
all sections related to a subject, put something appropriate into the
`Man-switches' variable, which see.Fman-follow
Get a Un*x manual page of the item under point and put it in a buffer.Vmessage-from-style
*Specifies how "From" headers look.

If nil, they contain just the return address like:
	king@grassland.com
If `parens', they look like:
	king@grassland.com (Elvis Parsley)
If `angles', they look like:
	Elvis Parsley <king@grassland.com>

Otherwise, most addresses look like `angles', but they look like
`parens' if `angles' would need quoting and `parens' would not.Vmessage-signature-separator
Regexp matching the signature separator.Vmessage-user-organization-file
*Local news organization file.Vmessage-send-mail-function
Function to call to send the current buffer as mail.
The headers should be delimited by a line whose contents match the
variable `mail-header-separator'.

Valid values include `message-send-mail-with-sendmail' (the default),
`message-send-mail-with-mh', `message-send-mail-with-qmail',
`smtpmail-send-it' and `feedmail-send-it'.

See also `send-mail-function'.Vmessage-citation-line-function
*Function called to insert the "Whomever writes:" line.Vmessage-yank-prefix
*Prefix inserted on the lines of yanked messages.Vmessage-cite-function
*Function for citing an original message.
Predefined functions include `message-cite-original' and
`message-cite-original-without-signature'.
Note that `message-cite-original' uses `mail-citation-hook' if that is non-nil.Vmessage-indent-citation-function
*Function for modifying a citation just inserted in the mail buffer.
This can also be a list of functions.  Each function can find the
citation between (point) and (mark t).  And each function should leave
point and mark around the citation text as modified.Vmessage-signature
*String to be inserted at the end of the message buffer.
If t, the `message-signature-file' file will be inserted instead.
If a function, the result from the function will be used instead.
If a form, the result from the form will be used instead.Vmessage-signature-file
*Name of file containing the text inserted at end of message buffer.
Ignored if the named file doesn't exist.
If nil, don't insert a signature.Fmessage-mode

Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `minibuffer-electric-default-mode'.Fminibuffer-electric-default-mode
Toggle Minibuffer Electric Default mode
When active, minibuffer prompts that show a default value only show the
default when it's applicable -- that is, when hitting RET would yield
the default value.  If the user modifies the input such that hitting RET
would enter a non-default value, the prompt is modified to remove the
default indication.

With prefix argument ARG, turn on if positive, otherwise off.
Returns non-nil if the new state is enabled.Fconvert-mocklisp-buffer

Convert morse coded text in region to ordinary ASCII text.Fmouse-sel-mode
Toggle Mouse Sel mode.
With prefix ARG, turn Mouse Sel mode on if and only if ARG is positive.
Returns the new status of Mouse Sel mode (non-nil means on).

When Mouse Sel mode is enabled, mouse selection is enhanced in various ways:

- Clicking mouse-1 starts (cancels) selection, dragging extends it.

- Clicking or dragging mouse-3 extends the selection as well.

- Double-clicking on word constituents selects words.
Double-clicking on symbol constituents selects symbols.
Double-clicking on quotes or parentheses selects sexps.
Double-clicking on whitespace selects whitespace.
Triple-clicking selects lines.
Quad-clicking selects paragraphs.

- Selecting sets the region & X primary selection, but does NOT affect
the kill-ring, nor do the kill-ring function change the X selection.
Because the mouse handlers set the primary selection directly,
mouse-sel sets the variables interprogram-cut-function and
interprogram-paste-function to nil.

- Clicking mouse-2 inserts the contents of the primary selection at
the mouse position (or point, if `mouse-yank-at-point' is non-nil).

- Pressing mouse-2 while selecting or extending copies selection
to the kill ring.  Pressing mouse-1 or mouse-3 kills it.

- Double-clicking mouse-3 also kills selection.

- M-mouse-1, M-mouse-2 & M-mouse-3 work similarly to mouse-1, mouse-2
& mouse-3, but operate on the X secondary selection rather than the
primary selection and region.Fmpuz
Multiplication puzzle with GNU Emacs.Vmsb-mode

See the command `msb-mode' for a description of this minor-mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `msb-mode'.Fmsb-mode
Toggle Msb mode.
With arg, turn Msb mode on if and only if arg is positive.
This mode overrides the binding(s) of `mouse-buffer-menu' to provide a
different buffer menu using the function `msb'.Flist-character-sets
Display a list of all character sets.

The ID-NUM column contains a charset identification number
  for internal Emacs use.

The MULTIBYTE-FORM column contains a format of multibyte sequence
  of characters in the charset for buffer and string
  by one to four hexadecimal digits.
  `xx' stands for any byte in the range 0..127.
  `XX' stands for any byte in the range 160..255.

The D column contains a dimension of this character set.
The CH column contains a number of characters in a block of this character set.
The FINAL-CHAR column contains an ISO-2022's <final-char> to use for
  designating this character set in ISO-2022-based coding systems.

With prefix arg, the output format gets more cryptic,
but still shows the full information.Fread-charset
Read a character set from the minibuffer, prompting with string PROMPT.
It reads an Emacs' character set listed in the variable `charset-list'

TYPE should be `list' or `vector'.Fstring-to-list
Return a list of characters in STRING.Fstring-to-vector
Return a vector of characters in STRING.Fstore-substring
Embed OBJ (string or character) at index IDX of STRING.Ftruncate-string-to-width
Truncate string STR to end at column END-COLUMN.
The optional 3rd arg START-COLUMN, if non-nil, specifies
the starting column; that means to return the characters occupying
columns START-COLUMN ... END-COLUMN of STR.

The optional 4th arg PADDING, if non-nil, specifies a padding character
to add at the end of the result if STR doesn't reach column END-COLUMN,
or if END-COLUMN comes in the middle of a character in STR.
PADDING is also added at the beginning of the result
if column START-COLUMN appears in the middle of a character in STR.

If PADDING is nil, no padding is added in these cases, so
the resulting string may be narrower than END-COLUMN.Fnested-alist-p
Return t if OBJ is a nested alist.

Nested alist is a list of the form (ENTRY . BRANCHES), where ENTRY is
any Lisp object, and BRANCHES is a list of cons cells of the form
(KEY-ELEMENT . NESTED-ALIST).

You can use a nested alist to store any Lisp object (ENTRY) for a key
sequence KEYSEQ, where KEYSEQ is a sequence of KEY-ELEMENT.  KEYSEQ
can be a string, a vector, or a list.Fset-nested-alist
Set ENTRY for KEYSEQ in a nested alist ALIST.
Optional 4th arg LEN non-nil means the first LEN elements in KEYSEQ
 is considered.
Optional argument BRANCHES if non-nil is branches for a keyseq
longer than KEYSEQ.
See the documentation of `nested-alist-p' for more detail.Flookup-nested-alist
Look up key sequence KEYSEQ in nested alist ALIST.  Return the definition.
Optional 1st argument LEN specifies the length of KEYSEQ.
Optional 2nd argument START specifies index of the starting key.
The returned value is normally a nested alist of which
car part is the entry for KEYSEQ.
If ALIST is not deep enough for KEYSEQ, return number which is
 how many key elements at the front of KEYSEQ it takes
 to reach a leaf in ALIST.
Optional 3rd argument NIL-FOR-TOO-LONG non-nil means return nil
 even if ALIST is not deep enough.Fcoding-system-eol-type-mnemonic

Return the value of CODING-SYSTEM's translation-table-for-encode property.Fcoding-system-equal
Return t if and only if CODING-SYSTEM-1 and CODING-SYSTEM-2 are identical.
Two coding systems are identical if two symbols are equal
or one is an alias of the other.Fdetect-coding-with-priority
Detect a coding system of the text between FROM and TO with PRIORITY-LIST.
PRIORITY-LIST is an alist of coding categories vs the corresponding
coding systems ordered by priority.Fdetect-coding-with-language-environment
Detect a coding system of the text between FROM and TO with LANG-ENV.
The detection takes into account the coding system priorities for the
language environment LANG-ENV.Vmouse-wheel-mode
Non-nil if Mouse-Wheel mode is enabled.
See the command `mouse-wheel-mode' for a description of this minor-mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `mouse-wheel-mode'.Fmouse-wheel-mode
Toggle mouse wheel support.
With prefix argument ARG, turn on if positive, otherwise off.
Returns non-nil if the new state is enabled.Fmwheel-install
Enable mouse wheel support.Ftraceroute

from SEARCH-STRING.  With argument, prompt for whois server.Fnetwork-connection-to-service
Open a network connection to SERVICE on HOST.Fnetwork-connection
Open a network connection to HOST on PORT.Vcomment-column
*Column to indent right-margin comments to.
Setting this variable automatically makes it local to the current buffer.
Each mode establishes a different default value for this variable; you
can set the value for a particular mode using that mode's hook.Vcomment-start
*String to insert to start a new comment, or nil if no comment syntax.Vcomment-start-skip
*Regexp to match the start of a comment plus everything up to its body.
If there are any \(...\) pairs, the comment delimiter text is held to begin
at the place matched by the close of the first pair.Vcomment-end-skip
Regexp to match the end of a comment plus everything up to its body.Vcomment-end
*String to insert to end a new comment.
Should be an empty string if comments are terminated by end-of-line.Vcomment-indent-function
Function to compute desired indentation for a comment.
This function is called with no args with point at the beginning of
the comment's starting delimiter and should return either the desired
column indentation or nil.
If nil is returned, indentation is delegated to `indent-according-to-mode'.Vcomment-style
*Style to be used for `comment-region'.
See `comment-styles' for a list of available styles.Vcomment-padding
Padding string that `comment-region' puts between comment chars and text.
Can also be an integer which will be automatically turned into a string
of the corresponding number of spaces.

Extra spacing between the comment characters and the comment text
makes the comment easier to read.  Default is " ".  nil means 0.Vcomment-multi-line
*Non-nil means \[comment-indent-new-line] continues comments, with no new terminator or starter.
This is obsolete because you might as well use \[newline-and-indent].Fcomment-indent-default
Default for `comment-indent-function'.Fcomment-indent
Indent this line's comment to comment column, or insert an empty comment.
If CONTINUE is non-nil, use the `comment-continue' markers if any.Fcomment-set-column
Set the comment column based on point.
With no ARG, set the comment column to the current column.
With just minus as arg, kill any comment on this line.
With any other arg, set comment column to indentation of the previous comment
 and then align or create a comment on this line at that column.Fcomment-kill
Kill the comment on this line, if any.
With prefix ARG, kill comments on that many lines starting with this one.Funcomment-region
Uncomment each line in the BEG..END region.
The numeric prefix ARG can specify a number of chars to remove from the
comment markers.Fcomment-region
Comment or uncomment each line in the region.
With just \[universal-argument] prefix arg, uncomment each line in region BEG..END.
Numeric prefix arg ARG means use ARG comment characters.
If ARG is negative, delete that many comment characters instead.
By default, comments start at the left margin, are terminated on each line,
even for syntax in which newline does not end the comment and blank lines
do not get comments.  This can be changed with `comment-style'.

The strings used as comment starts are built from
`comment-start' without trailing spaces and `comment-padding'.Fcomment-dwim
Call the comment command you want (Do What I Mean).
If the region is active and `transient-mark-mode' is on, call
  `comment-region' (unless it only consists of comments, in which
  case it calls `uncomment-region').
Else, if the current line is empty, insert a comment and indent it.
Else if a prefix ARG is specified, call `comment-kill'.
Else, call `comment-indent'.Fcomment-indent-new-line
Break line at point and indent, continuing comment if within one.
This indents the body of the continued comment
under the previous comment line.

This command is intended for styles where you write a comment per line,
starting a new comment (and terminating it if necessary) on each line.
If you want to continue one comment across several lines, use \[newline-and-indent].

If a fill column is specified, it overrides the use of the comment column
or comment indentation.

The inserted newline is marked hard if variable `use-hard-newlines' is true,
unless optional argument SOFT is non-nil.Fnndoc-add-type
Add document DEFINITION to the list of nndoc document definitions.
If POSITION is nil or `last', the definition will be added
as the last checked definition, if t or `first', add as the
first definition, and if any other symbol, add after that
symbol in the alist.Fnnfolder-generate-active-file
Look for mbox folders in the nnfolder directory and make them into groups.
This command does not work if you use short group names.Fnnkiboze-generate-groups

Make an outbound package of SOUP replies.Fnnsoup-set-variables
Use the SOUP methods for posting news and mailing mail.Fnnsoup-revert-variables
Revert posting and mailing methods to the standard Emacs methods.Vdisabled-command-hook
Function to call to handle disabled commands.
If nil, the feature is disabled, i.e., all commands work normally.Fenable-command
Allow COMMAND to be executed without special confirmation from now on.
The user's .emacs file is altered so that this will apply
to future sessions.Fdisable-command
Require special confirmation to execute COMMAND from now on.
The user's .emacs file is altered so that this will apply
to future sessions.Fnroff-mode
Major mode for editing text intended for nroff to format.
\{nroff-mode-map}
Turning on Nroff mode runs `text-mode-hook', then `nroff-mode-hook'.
Also, try `nroff-electric-mode', for automatically inserting
closing requests for requests that are used in matched pairs.Foctave-help
Get help on Octave symbols from the Octave info files.
Look up KEY in the function, operator and variable indices of the files
specified by `octave-help-files'.
If KEY is not a string, prompt for it with completion.Finferior-octave
Run an inferior Octave process, I/O via `inferior-octave-buffer'.
This buffer is put in Inferior Octave mode.  See `inferior-octave-mode'.

Unless ARG is non-nil, switches to this buffer.

The elements of the list `inferior-octave-startup-args' are sent as
command line arguments to the inferior Octave process on startup.

Additional commands to be executed on startup can be provided either in
the file specified by `inferior-octave-startup-file' or by the default
startup file, `~/.emacs-octave'.Foctave-mode
Major mode for editing Octave code.

This mode makes it easier to write Octave code by helping with
indentation, doing some of the typing for you (with Abbrev mode) and by
showing keywords, comments, strings, etc. in different faces (with
Font Lock mode on terminals that support it).

Octave itself is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.  Function definitions
can also be stored in files, and it can be used in a batch mode (which
is why you need this mode!).

The latest released version of Octave is always available via anonymous
ftp from bevo.che.wisc.edu in the directory `/pub/octave'.  Complete
source and binaries for several popular systems are available.

Type \[list-abbrevs] to display the built-in abbrevs for Octave keywords.

Keybindings
===========

\{octave-mode-map}

Variables you can use to customize Octave mode
==============================================

octave-auto-indent
  Non-nil means indent current line after a semicolon or space.
  Default is nil.

octave-auto-newline
  Non-nil means auto-insert a newline and indent after a semicolon.
  Default is nil.

octave-blink-matching-block
  Non-nil means show matching begin of block when inserting a space,
  newline or semicolon after an else or end keyword.  Default is t.

octave-block-offset
  Extra indentation applied to statements in block structures.
  Default is 2.

octave-continuation-offset
  Extra indentation applied to Octave continuation lines.
  Default is 4.

octave-continuation-string
  String used for Octave continuation lines.
  Default is a backslash.

octave-mode-startup-message
  Nil means do not display the Octave mode startup message.
  Default is t.

octave-send-echo-input
  Non-nil means always display `inferior-octave-buffer' after sending a
  command to the inferior Octave process.

octave-send-line-auto-forward
  Non-nil means always go to the next unsent line of Octave code after
  sending a line to the inferior Octave process.

octave-send-echo-input
  Non-nil means echo input sent to the inferior Octave process.

Turning on Octave mode runs the hook `octave-mode-hook'.

To begin using this mode for all `.m' files that you edit, add the
following lines to your `.emacs' file:

  (autoload 'octave-mode "octave-mod" nil t)
  (setq auto-mode-alist
        (cons '("\\.m$" . octave-mode) auto-mode-alist))

To automatically turn on the abbrev, auto-fill and font-lock features,
add the following lines to your `.emacs' file as well:

  (add-hook 'octave-mode-hook
	    (lambda ()
	      (abbrev-mode 1)
	      (auto-fill-mode 1)
	      (if (eq window-system 'x)
		  (font-lock-mode 1))))

To submit a problem report, enter \[octave-submit-bug-report] from an Octave mode buffer.
This automatically sets up a mail buffer with version information
already added.  You just need to add a description of the problem,
including a reproducible test case and send the message.Flist-options
Display a list of Emacs user options, with values and documentation.
It is now better to use Customize instead.Fedit-options
Edit a list of Emacs user option values.
Selects a buffer containing such a list,
in which there are commands to set the option values.
Type \[describe-mode] in that buffer for a list of commands.

The Custom feature is intended to make this obsolete.Foutline-mode
Set major mode for editing outlines with selective display.
Headings are lines which start with asterisks: one for major headings,
two for subheadings, etc.  Lines not starting with asterisks are body lines.

Body text or subheadings under a heading can be made temporarily
invisible, or visible again.  Invisible lines are attached to the end
of the heading, so they move with it, if the line is killed and yanked
back.  A heading with text hidden under it is marked with an ellipsis (...).

Commands:\<outline-mode-map>
\[outline-next-visible-heading]   outline-next-visible-heading      move by visible headings
\[outline-previous-visible-heading]   outline-previous-visible-heading
\[outline-forward-same-level]   outline-forward-same-level        similar but skip subheadings
\[outline-backward-same-level]   outline-backward-same-level
\[outline-up-heading]   outline-up-heading		    move from subheading to heading

\[hide-body]	make all text invisible (not headings).
\[show-all]	make everything in buffer visible.

The remaining commands are used when point is on a heading line.
They apply to some of the body or subheadings of that heading.
\[hide-subtree]   hide-subtree	make body and subheadings invisible.
\[show-subtree]   show-subtree	make body and subheadings visible.
\[show-children]   show-children	make direct subheadings visible.
		 No effect on body, or subheadings 2 or more levels down.
		 With arg N, affects subheadings N levels down.
\[hide-entry]	   make immediately following body invisible.
\[show-entry]	   make it visible.
\[hide-leaves]	   make body under heading and under its subheadings invisible.
		     The subheadings remain visible.
\[show-branches]  make all subheadings at all levels visible.

The variable `outline-regexp' can be changed to control what is a heading.
A line is a heading if `outline-regexp' matches something at the
beginning of the line.  The longer the match, the deeper the level.

Turning on outline mode calls the value of `text-mode-hook' and then of
`outline-mode-hook', if they are non-nil.Foutline-minor-mode
Toggle Outline minor mode.
With arg, turn Outline minor mode on if arg is positive, off otherwise.
See the command `outline-mode' for more information on this mode.Vshow-paren-mode
Non-nil if Show-Paren mode is enabled.
See the command `show-paren-mode' for a description of this minor-mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `show-paren-mode'.Fshow-paren-mode
Toggle Show Paren mode.
With prefix ARG, turn Show Paren mode on if and only if ARG is positive.
Returns the new status of Show Paren mode (non-nil means on).

When Show Paren mode is enabled, any matching parenthesis is highlighted
in `show-paren-style' after `show-paren-delay' seconds of Emacs idle time.Fpascal-mode
Major mode for editing Pascal code. \<pascal-mode-map>
TAB indents for Pascal code.  Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.

\[pascal-complete-word] completes the word around current point with respect to position in code
\[pascal-show-completions] shows all possible completions at this point.

Other useful functions are:

\[pascal-mark-defun]	- Mark function.
\[pascal-insert-block]	- insert begin ... end;
\[pascal-star-comment]	- insert (* ... *)
\[pascal-comment-area]	- Put marked area in a comment, fixing nested comments.
\[pascal-uncomment-area]	- Uncomment an area commented with \[pascal-comment-area].
\[pascal-beg-of-defun]	- Move to beginning of current function.
\[pascal-end-of-defun]	- Move to end of current function.
\[pascal-goto-defun]	- Goto function prompted for in the minibuffer.
\[pascal-outline]	- Enter pascal-outline-mode (see also pascal-outline).

Variables controlling indentation/edit style:

 pascal-indent-level (default 3)
    Indentation of Pascal statements with respect to containing block.
 pascal-case-indent (default 2)
    Indentation for case statements.
 pascal-auto-newline (default nil)
    Non-nil means automatically newline after semicolons and the punctuation
    mark after an end.
 pascal-indent-nested-functions (default t)
    Non-nil means nested functions are indented.
 pascal-tab-always-indent (default t)
    Non-nil means TAB in Pascal mode should always reindent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 pascal-auto-endcomments (default t)
    Non-nil means a comment { ... } is set after the ends which ends cases and
    functions. The name of the function or case will be set between the braces.
 pascal-auto-lineup (default t)
    List of contexts where auto lineup of :'s or ='s should be done.

See also the user variables pascal-type-keywords, pascal-start-keywords and
pascal-separator-keywords.

Turning on Pascal mode calls the value of the variable pascal-mode-hook with
no args, if that value is non-nil.Fpc-bindings-mode
Set up certain key bindings for PC compatibility.
The keys affected are:
Delete (and its variants) delete forward instead of backward.
C-Backspace kills backward a word (as C-Delete normally would).
M-Backspace does undo.
Home and End move to beginning and end of line
C-Home and C-End move to beginning and end of buffer.
C-Escape does list-buffers.Fpc-selection-mode
Change mark behaviour to emulate Motif, MAC or MS-Windows cut and paste style.

This mode enables Delete Selection mode and Transient Mark mode.

The arrow keys (and others) are bound to new functions
which modify the status of the mark.

The ordinary arrow keys disable the mark.
The shift-arrow keys move, leaving the mark behind.

C-LEFT and C-RIGHT move back or forward one word, disabling the mark.
S-C-LEFT and S-C-RIGHT move back or forward one word, leaving the mark behind.

M-LEFT and M-RIGHT move back or forward one word or sexp, disabling the mark.
S-M-LEFT and S-M-RIGHT move back or forward one word or sexp, leaving the mark
behind. To control wether these keys move word-wise or sexp-wise set the
variable pc-select-meta-moves-sexps after loading pc-select.el but before
turning pc-selection-mode on.

C-DOWN and C-UP move back or forward a paragraph, disabling the mark.
S-C-DOWN and S-C-UP move back or forward a paragraph, leaving the mark behind.

HOME moves to beginning of line, disabling the mark.
S-HOME moves to beginning of line, leaving the mark behind.
With Ctrl or Meta, these keys move to beginning of buffer instead.

END moves to end of line, disabling the mark.
S-END moves to end of line, leaving the mark behind.
With Ctrl or Meta, these keys move to end of buffer instead.

PRIOR or PAGE-UP scrolls and disables the mark.
S-PRIOR or S-PAGE-UP scrolls and leaves the mark behind.

S-DELETE kills the region (`kill-region').
S-INSERT yanks text from the kill ring (`yank').
C-INSERT copies the region into the kill ring (`copy-region-as-kill').

In addition, certain other PC bindings are imitated (to avoid this, set
the variable pc-select-selection-keys-only to t after loading pc-select.el
but before calling pc-selection-mode):

  F6           other-window
  DELETE       delete-char
  C-DELETE     kill-line
  M-DELETE     kill-word
  C-M-DELETE   kill-sexp
  C-BACKSPACE  backward-kill-word
  M-BACKSPACE  undoVpc-selection-mode

The current direction is displayed in the mode line.  The initial
direction is right.  Whitespace is inserted and tabs are changed to
spaces when required by movement.  You can move around in the buffer
with these commands:
  \[picture-move-down]	  Move vertically to SAME column in previous line.
  \[picture-move-up]	  Move vertically to SAME column in next line.
  \[picture-end-of-line]	  Move to column following last non-whitespace character.
  \[picture-forward-column]	  Move right inserting spaces if required.
  \[picture-backward-column]	  Move left changing tabs to spaces if required.
  C-c C-f Move in direction of current picture motion.
  C-c C-b Move in opposite direction of current picture motion.
  Return  Move to beginning of next line.
You can edit tabular text with these commands:
  M-Tab	  Move to column beneath (or at) next interesting character.
	    `Indents' relative to a previous line.
  Tab	  Move to next stop in tab stop list.
  C-c Tab Set tab stops according to context of this line.
	    With ARG resets tab stops to default (global) value.
	    See also documentation of variable	picture-tab-chars
	    which defines "interesting character".  You can manually
	    change the tab stop list with command \[edit-tab-stops].
You can manipulate text with these commands:
  C-d	  Clear (replace) ARG columns after point without moving.
  C-c C-d Delete char at point - the command normally assigned to C-d.
  \[picture-backward-clear-column]  Clear (replace) ARG columns before point, moving back over them.
  \[picture-clear-line]	  Clear ARG lines, advancing over them.	 The cleared
	    text is saved in the kill ring.
  \[picture-open-line]	  Open blank line(s) beneath current line.
You can manipulate rectangles with these commands:
  C-c C-k Clear (or kill) a rectangle and save it.
  C-c C-w Like C-c C-k except rectangle is saved in named register.
  C-c C-y Overlay (or insert) currently saved rectangle at point.
  C-c C-x Like C-c C-y except rectangle is taken from named register.
  C-c C-r Draw a rectangular box around mark and point.
  \[copy-rectangle-to-register]   Copies a rectangle to a register.
  \[advertised-undo]   Can undo effects of rectangle overlay commands
	    commands if invoked soon enough.
You can return to the previous mode with:
  C-c C-c Which also strips trailing whitespace from every line.
	    Stripping is suppressed by supplying an argument.

Entry to this mode calls the value of  picture-mode-hook  if non-nil.

Note that Picture mode commands will work outside of Picture mode, but
they are not defaultly assigned to keys.Fpong
Play pong and waste time.
This is an implementation of the classical game pong.
Move left and right bats and try to bounce the ball to your opponent.

pong-mode keybindings:\<pong-mode-map>

\{pong-mode-map}Fpp
Output the pretty-printed representation of OBJECT, any Lisp object.
Quoting characters are printed as needed to make output that `read'
can handle, whenever this is possible.
Output stream is STREAM, or value of `standard-output' (which see).Fpp-eval-expression
Evaluate EXPRESSION and pretty-print value into a new display buffer.
If the pretty-printed value fits on one line, the message line is used
instead.  The value is also consed onto the front of the list
in the variable `values'.Fpp-eval-last-sexp
Run `pp-eval-expression' on sexp before point (which see).
With argument, pretty-print output into current buffer.
Ignores leading comment characters.Fprolog-mode
Major mode for editing Prolog code for Prologs.
Blank lines and `%%...' separate paragraphs.  `%'s start comments.
Commands:
\{prolog-mode-map}
Entry to this mode calls the value of `prolog-mode-hook'
if that value is non-nil.Frun-prolog
Run an inferior Prolog process, input and output via buffer *prolog*.Vbdf-directory-list
*List of directories to search for `BDF' font files.
The default value is '("/usr/local/share/emacs/fonts/bdf").Vps-multibyte-buffer
*Specifies the multi-byte buffer handling.

Valid values are:

  nil                     This is the value to use the default settings which
			  is by default for printing buffer with only ASCII
			  and Latin characters.   The default setting can be
			  changed by setting the variable
			  `ps-mule-font-info-database-default' differently.
			  The initial value of this variable is
			  `ps-mule-font-info-database-latin' (see
			  documentation).

  `non-latin-printer'     This is the value to use when you have a Japanese
			  or Korean PostScript printer and want to print
			  buffer with ASCII, Latin-1, Japanese (JISX0208 and
			  JISX0201-Kana) and Korean characters.  At present,
			  it was not tested the Korean characters printing.
			  If you have a korean PostScript printer, please,
			  test it.

  `bdf-font'              This is the value to use when you want to print
			  buffer with BDF fonts.  BDF fonts include both latin
			  and non-latin fonts.  BDF (Bitmap Distribution
			  Format) is a format used for distributing X's font
			  source file.  BDF fonts are included in
			  `intlfonts-1.2' which is a collection of X11 fonts
			  for all characters supported by Emacs.  In order to
			  use this value, be sure to have installed
			  `intlfonts-1.2' and set the variable
			  `bdf-directory-list' appropriately (see ps-bdf.el for
			  documentation of this variable).

  `bdf-font-except-latin' This is like `bdf-font' except that it is used
			  PostScript default fonts to print ASCII and Latin-1
			  characters.  This is convenient when you want or
			  need to use both latin and non-latin characters on
			  the same buffer.  See `ps-font-family',
			  `ps-header-font-family' and `ps-font-info-database'.

Any other value is treated as nil.Fps-mule-prepare-ascii-font

example `letter', `legal' or `a4'.Fps-print-customize
Customization of ps-print group.Fps-print-buffer
Generate and print a PostScript image of the buffer.

Interactively, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the
user for a file name, and saves the PostScript image in that file instead of
sending it to the printer.

Noninteractively, the argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it is nil,
send the image to the printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript
image in a file with that name.Fps-print-buffer-with-faces
Generate and print a PostScript image of the buffer.
Like `ps-print-buffer', but includes font, color, and underline information in
the generated image.  This command works only if you are using a window system,
so it has a way to determine color values.Fps-print-region
Generate and print a PostScript image of the region.
Like `ps-print-buffer', but prints just the current region.Fps-print-region-with-faces
Generate and print a PostScript image of the region.

Use the command `ps-despool' to send the spooled images to the printer.Fps-spool-region-with-faces
Generate a PostScript image of the region and spool locally.
Like `ps-spool-region', but includes font, color, and underline information in
the generated image.  This command works only if you are using a window system,
so it has a way to determine color values.

Use the command `ps-despool' to send the spooled images to the printer.Fps-despool
Send the spooled PostScript to the printer.

Interactively, when you use a prefix argument (C-u), the command prompts the
user for a file name, and saves the spooled PostScript image in that file
instead of sending it to the printer.

Noninteractively, the argument FILENAME is treated as follows: if it is nil,
send the image to the printer.  If FILENAME is a string, save the PostScript
image in a file with that name.Fps-line-lengths
Display the correspondence between a line length and a font size, using the
current ps-print setup.
Try: pr -t file | awk '{printf "%3d %s
", length($0), $0}' | sort -r | headFps-nb-pages-buffer

Return the current PostScript-generation setup.Fps-extend-face-list
Extend face in ALIST-SYM.

If optional MERGE-P is non-nil, extensions in FACE-EXTENSION-LIST are merged
with face extension in ALIST-SYM; otherwise, overrides.

If optional ALIST-SYM is nil, it's used `ps-print-face-extension-alist';
otherwise, it should be an alist symbol.

The elements in FACE-EXTENSION-LIST is like those for `ps-extend-face'.

See `ps-extend-face' for documentation.Fps-extend-face
Extend face in ALIST-SYM.

If optional MERGE-P is non-nil, extensions in FACE-EXTENSION list are merged
with face extensions in ALIST-SYM; otherwise, overrides.

If optional ALIST-SYM is nil, it's used `ps-print-face-extension-alist';
otherwise, it should be an alist symbol.

The elements of FACE-EXTENSION list have the form:

   (FACE-NAME FOREGROUND BACKGROUND EXTENSION...)

FACE-NAME is a face name symbol.

FOREGROUND and BACKGROUND may be nil or a string that denotes the
foreground and background colors respectively.

EXTENSION is one of the following symbols:
   bold      - use bold font.
   italic    - use italic font.
   underline - put a line under text.
   strikeout - like underline, but the line is in middle of text.
   overline  - like underline, but the line is over the text.
   shadow    - text will have a shadow.
   box       - text will be surrounded by a box.
   outline   - print characters as hollow outlines.

If EXTENSION is any other symbol, it is ignored.Fquail-title
Return the title of the current Quail package.Fquail-use-package
Start using Quail package PACKAGE-NAME.
The remaining arguments are libraries to be loaded before using the package.

This activates input method defined by PACKAGE-NAME by running
`quail-activate', which see.Fquail-define-package
Define NAME as a new Quail package for input LANGUAGE.
TITLE is a string to be displayed at mode-line to indicate this package.
Optional arguments are GUIDANCE, DOCSTRING, TRANSLATION-KEYS,
 FORGET-LAST-SELECTION, DETERMINISTIC, KBD-TRANSLATE, SHOW-LAYOUT,
 CREATE-DECODE-MAP, MAXIMUM-SHORTEST, OVERLAY-PLIST,
 UPDATE-TRANSLATION-FUNCTION, CONVERSION-KEYS and SIMPLE.

GUIDANCE specifies how a guidance string is shown in echo area.
If it is t, list of all possible translations for the current key is shown
 with the currently selected translation being highlighted.
If it is an alist, the element has the form (CHAR . STRING).  Each character
 in the current key is searched in the list and the corresponding string is
 shown.
If it is nil, the current key is shown.

DOCSTRING is the documentation string of this package.  The command
`describe-input-method' shows this string while replacing the form
\=\<VAR> in the string by the value of VAR.  That value should be a
string.  For instance, the form \=\<quail-translation-docstring> is
replaced by a description about how to select a translation from a
list of candidates.

TRANSLATION-KEYS specifies additional key bindings used while translation
region is active.  It is an alist of single key character vs. corresponding
command to be called.

FORGET-LAST-SELECTION non-nil means a selected translation is not kept
for the future to translate the same key.  If this flag is nil, a
translation selected for a key is remembered so that it can be the
first candidate when the same key is entered later.

DETERMINISTIC non-nil means the first candidate of translation is
selected automatically without allowing users to select another
translation for a key.  In this case, unselected translations are of
no use for an interactive use of Quail but can be used by some other
programs.  If this flag is non-nil, FORGET-LAST-SELECTION is also set
to t.

KBD-TRANSLATE non-nil means input characters are translated from a
user's keyboard layout to the standard keyboard layout.  See the
documentation of `quail-keyboard-layout' and
`quail-keyboard-layout-standard' for more detail.

SHOW-LAYOUT non-nil means the `quail-help' command should show
the user's keyboard layout visually with translated characters.
If KBD-TRANSLATE is set, it is desirable to set also this flag unless
this package defines no translations for single character keys.

CREATE-DECODE-MAP non-nil means decode map is also created.  A decode
map is an alist of translations and corresponding original keys.
Although this map is not used by Quail itself, it can be used by some
other programs.  For instance, Vietnamese supporting needs this map to
convert Vietnamese text to VIQR format which uses only ASCII
characters to represent Vietnamese characters.

MAXIMUM-SHORTEST non-nil means break key sequence to get maximum
length of the shortest sequence.  When we don't have a translation of
key "..ABCD" but have translations of "..AB" and "CD..", break
the key at "..AB" and start translation of "CD..".  Hangul
packages, for instance, use this facility.  If this flag is nil, we
break the key just at "..ABC" and start translation of "D..".

OVERLAY-PLIST if non-nil is a property list put on an overlay which
covers Quail translation region.

UPDATE-TRANSLATION-FUNCTION if non-nil is a function to call to update
the current translation region according to a new translation data.  By
default, a translated text or a user's key sequence (if no translation
for it) is inserted.

CONVERSION-KEYS specifies additional key bindings used while
conversion region is active.  It is an alist of single key character
vs. corresponding command to be called.

If SIMPLE is non-nil, then we do not alter the meanings of
commands such as C-f, C-b, C-n, C-p and TAB; they are treated as
non-Quail commands.Fquail-set-keyboard-layout
Set the current keyboard layout to the same as keyboard KBD-TYPE.

Since some Quail packages depends on a physical layout of keys (not
characters generated by them), those are created by assuming the
standard layout defined in `quail-keyboard-layout-standard'.  This
function tells Quail system the layout of your keyboard so that what
you type is correctly handled.Fquail-show-keyboard-layout
Show the physical layout of the keyboard type KEYBOARD-TYPE.

The variable `quail-keyboard-layout-type' holds the currently selected
keyboard type.Fquail-define-rules
Define translation rules of the current Quail package.
Each argument is a list of KEY and TRANSLATION.
KEY is a string meaning a sequence of keystrokes to be translated.
TRANSLATION is a character, a string, a vector, a Quail map, or a function.
If it is a character, it is the sole translation of KEY.
If it is a string, each character is a candidate for the translation.
If it is a vector, each element (string or character) is a candidate
  for the translation.
In these cases, a key specific Quail map is generated and assigned to KEY.

If TRANSLATION is a Quail map or a function symbol which returns a Quail map,
 it is used to handle KEY.

The first argument may be an alist of annotations for the following
rules.  Each element has the form (ANNOTATION . VALUE), where
ANNOTATION is a symbol indicating the annotation type.  Currently
the following annotation types are supported.

  append -- the value non-nil means that the following rules should
	be appended to the rules of the current Quail package.

  face -- the value is a face to use for displaying TRANSLATIONs in
	candidate list.

  advice -- the value is a function to call after one of RULES is
	selected.  The function is called with one argument, the
	selected TRANSLATION string, after the TRANSLATION is
	inserted.

  no-decode-map --- the value non-nil means that decoding map is not
	generated for the following translations.Fquail-install-map
Install the Quail map MAP in the current Quail package.

Optional 2nd arg NAME, if non-nil, is a name of Quail package for
which to install MAP.

The installed map can be referred by the function `quail-map'.Fquail-install-decode-map
Install the Quail decode map DECODE-MAP in the current Quail package.

Optional 2nd arg NAME, if non-nil, is a name of Quail package for
which to install MAP.

The installed decode map can be referred by the function `quail-decode-map'.Fquail-defrule
Add one translation rule, KEY to TRANSLATION, in the current Quail package.
KEY is a string meaning a sequence of keystrokes to be translated.
TRANSLATION is a character, a string, a vector, a Quail map,
 a function, or a cons.
It it is a character, it is the sole translation of KEY.
If it is a string, each character is a candidate for the translation.
If it is a vector, each element (string or character) is a candidate
 for the translation.
If it is a cons, the car is one of the above and the cdr is a function
 to call when translating KEY (the return value is assigned to the
 variable `quail-current-data').  If the cdr part is not a function,
 the value itself is assigned to `quail-current-data'.
In these cases, a key specific Quail map is generated and assigned to KEY.

If TRANSLATION is a Quail map or a function symbol which returns a Quail map,
 it is used to handle KEY.

Optional 3rd argument NAME, if specified, says which Quail package
to define this translation rule in.  The default is to define it in the
current Quail package.

Optional 4th argument APPEND, if non-nil, appends TRANSLATION
to the current translations for KEY instead of replacing them.Fquail-defrule-internal
Define KEY as TRANS in a Quail map MAP.

If Optional 4th arg APPEND is non-nil, TRANS is appended to the
current translations for KEY instead of replacing them.

Optional 5th arg DECODE-MAP is a Quail decode map.

Optional 6th arg PROPS is a property list annotating TRANS.  See the
function `quail-define-rules' for the detail.Fquail-update-leim-list-file
Update entries for Quail packages in `LEIM' list file in directory DIRNAME.
DIRNAME is a directory containing Emacs input methods;
normally, it should specify the `leim' subdirectory
of the Emacs source tree.

It searches for Quail packages under `quail' subdirectory of DIRNAME,
and update the file "leim-list.el" in DIRNAME.

When called from a program, the remaining arguments are additional
directory names to search for Quail packages under `quail' subdirectory
of each directory.Vquickurl-reread-hook-postfix
Example `quickurl-postfix' text that adds a local variable to the
`quickurl-url-file' so that if you edit it by hand it will ensure that
`quickurl-urls' is updated with the new URL list.

When referencing, you get a menu with all labels of a given type and
context of the label definition.  The selected label is inserted as a
\ref macro.

Citations can be made with `\[reftex-citation]' which will use a regular expression
to pull out a *formatted* list of articles from your BibTeX
database.  The selected citation is inserted as a \cite macro.

Index entries can be made with `\[reftex-index-selection-or-word]' which indexes the word at point
or the current selection.  More general index entries are created with
`\[reftex-index]'.  `\[reftex-display-index]' displays the compiled index.

bibtex entries (taken from the \bibliography command) and offers the
matching entries for selection.  The selected entry is formated according
to `reftex-cite-format' and inserted into the buffer.

If NO-INSERT is non-nil, nothing is inserted, only the selected key returned.

FORAT-KEY can be used to pre-select a citation format.

When called with one or two `C-u' prefixes, first rescans the document.
When called with a numeric prefix, make that many citations.  When
called with point inside the braces of a `\cite' command, it will
add another key, ignoring the value of `reftex-cite-format'.

The regular expression uses an expanded syntax: && is interpreted as `and'.
Thus, `aaaa&&bbb' matches entries which contain both `aaaa' and `bbb'.
While entering the regexp, completion on knows citation keys is possible.
`=' is a good regular expression to match all entries in all files.Freftex-index-phrases-mode
Major mode for managing the Index phrases of a LaTeX document.
This buffer was created with RefTeX.

To insert new phrases, use
 - `C-c \' in the LaTeX document to copy selection or word
 - `\[reftex-index-new-phrase]' in the phrases buffer.

To index phrases use one of:

\[reftex-index-this-phrase]     index current phrase
\[reftex-index-next-phrase]     index next phrase (or N with prefix arg)
\[reftex-index-all-phrases]     index all phrases
\[reftex-index-remaining-phrases]     index current and following phrases
\[reftex-index-region-phrases]     index the phrases in the region

You can sort the phrases in this buffer with \[reftex-index-sort-phrases].
To display information about the phrase at point, use \[reftex-index-phrases-info].

For more information see the RefTeX User Manual.

Here are all local bindings.

\{reftex-index-phrases-map}Fregexp-opt
Return a regexp to match a string in STRINGS.
Each string should be unique in STRINGS and should not contain any regexps,
quoted or not.  If optional PAREN is non-nil, ensure that the returned regexp
is enclosed by at least one regexp grouping construct.
The returned regexp is typically more efficient than the equivalent regexp:

 (let ((open (if PAREN "\\(" "")) (close (if PAREN "\\)" "")))
   (concat open (mapconcat 'regexp-quote STRINGS "\\|") close))

If PAREN is `words', then the resulting regexp is additionally surrounded
by \=\< and \>.Fregexp-opt-depth
Return the depth of REGEXP.
This means the number of regexp grouping constructs (parenthesised expressions)
in REGEXP.Frepeat
Repeat most recently executed command.
With prefix arg, apply new prefix arg to that command; otherwise, use
the prefix arg that was used before (if any).
This command is like the `.' command in the vi editor.

If this command is invoked by a multi-character key sequence, it can then
be repeated by repeating the final character of that sequence.  This behavior
can be modified by the global variable `repeat-on-final-keystroke'.Freporter-submit-bug-report
Begin submitting a bug report via email.

ADDRESS is the email address for the package's maintainer.  PKGNAME is
the name of the package (if you want to include version numbers,
you must put them into PKGNAME before calling this function).
Optional PRE-HOOKS and POST-HOOKS are passed to `reporter-dump-state'.
Optional SALUTATION is inserted at the top of the mail buffer,
and point is left after the salutation.

VARLIST is the list of variables to dump (see `reporter-dump-state'
for details).  The optional argument PRE-HOOKS and POST-HOOKS are
passed to `reporter-dump-state'.  Optional argument SALUTATION is text
to be inserted at the top of the mail buffer; in that case, point is
left after that text.

This function prompts for a summary if `reporter-prompt-for-summary-p'
is non-nil.

This function does not send a message; it uses the given information
to initialize a a messagem, which the user can then edit and finally send
(or decline to send).  The variable `mail-user-agent' controls which
mail-sending package is used for editing and sending the message.Freposition-window
Make the current definition and/or comment visible.
Further invocations move it to the top of the window or toggle the
visibility of comments that precede it.
  Point is left unchanged unless prefix ARG is supplied.
  If the definition is fully onscreen, it is moved to the top of the
window.  If it is partly offscreen, the window is scrolled to get the
definition (or as much as will fit) onscreen, unless point is in a comment
which is also partly offscreen, in which case the scrolling attempts to get
as much of the comment onscreen as possible.
  Initially `reposition-window' attempts to make both the definition and
preceding comments visible.  Further invocations toggle the visibility of
the comment lines.
  If ARG is non-nil, point may move in order to make the whole defun
visible (if only part could otherwise be made so), to make the defun line
visible (if point is in code and it could not be made so, or if only
comments, including the first comment line, are visible), or to make the
first comment line visible (if point is in a comment).Fresume-suspend-hook
Clear out the file used for transmitting args when Emacs resumes.Fring-p
Returns t if X is a ring; nil otherwise.Fmake-ring
Make a ring that can contain SIZE elements.Frlogin
Open a network login connection via `rlogin' with args INPUT-ARGS.
INPUT-ARGS should start with a host name; it may also contain
other arguments for `rlogin'.

Input is sent line-at-a-time to the remote connection.

Communication with the remote host is recorded in a buffer `*rlogin-HOST*'
(or `*rlogin-USER@HOST*' if the remote username differs).
If a prefix argument is given and the buffer `*rlogin-HOST*' already exists,
a new buffer with a different connection will be made.

When called from a program, if the optional second argument BUFFER is
a string or buffer, it specifies the buffer to use.

The variable `rlogin-program' contains the name of the actual program to
run.  It can be a relative or absolute path.

The variable `rlogin-explicit-args' is a list of arguments to give to
the rlogin when starting.  They are added after any arguments given in
INPUT-ARGS.

If the default value of `rlogin-directory-tracking-mode' is t, then the
default directory in that buffer is set to a remote (FTP) file name to
access your home directory on the remote machine.  Occasionally this causes
an error, if you cannot access the home directory on that machine.  This
error is harmless as long as you don't try to use that default directory.

If `rlogin-directory-tracking-mode' is neither t nor nil, then the default
directory is initially set up to your (local) home directory.
This is useful if the remote machine and your local machine
share the same files via NFS.  This is the default.

If you wish to change directory tracking styles during a session, use the
function `rlogin-directory-tracking-mode' rather than simply setting the
variable.Vrmail-dont-reply-to-names
*A regexp specifying names to prune of reply to messages.
A value of nil means exclude your own login name as an address
plus whatever is specified by `rmail-default-dont-reply-to-names'.Vrmail-default-dont-reply-to-names
A regular expression specifying part of the value of the default value of
the variable `rmail-dont-reply-to-names', for when the user does not set
`rmail-dont-reply-to-names' explicitly.  (The other part of the default
value is the user's name.)
It is useful to set this variable in the site customization file.Vrmail-ignored-headers
*Regexp to match header fields that Rmail should normally hide.
This variable is used for reformatting the message header,
which normally happens once for each message,
when you view the message for the first time in Rmail.
To make a change in this variable take effect
for a message that you have already viewed,
go to that message and type \[rmail-toggle-header] twice.Vrmail-displayed-headers
*Regexp to match Header fields that Rmail should display.
If nil, display all header fields except those matched by
`rmail-ignored-headers'.Vrmail-retry-ignored-headers
*Headers that should be stripped when retrying a failed message.Vrmail-highlighted-headers
*Regexp to match Header fields that Rmail should normally highlight.
A value of nil means don't highlight.
See also `rmail-highlight-face'.Vrmail-highlight-face
*Face used by Rmail for highlighting headers.Vrmail-delete-after-output
*Non-nil means automatically delete a message that is copied to a file.Vrmail-primary-inbox-list
*List of files which are inboxes for user's primary mail file `~/RMAIL'.
`nil' means the default, which is ("/usr/spool/mail/$USER")
(the name varies depending on the operating system,
and the value of the environment variable MAIL overrides it).Vrmail-mail-new-frame
*Non-nil means Rmail makes a new frame for composing outgoing mail.Vrmail-secondary-file-directory
*Directory for additional secondary Rmail files.Vrmail-secondary-file-regexp
*Regexp for which files are secondary Rmail files.Vrmail-confirm-expunge
*Whether and how to ask for confirmation before expunging deleted messages.Vrmail-mode-hook
List of functions to call when Rmail is invoked.Vrmail-get-new-mail-hook
List of functions to call when Rmail has retrieved new mail.Vrmail-show-message-hook
List of functions to call when Rmail displays a message.Vrmail-quit-hook
List of functions to call when quitting out of Rmail.Vrmail-delete-message-hook
List of functions to call when Rmail deletes a message.
When the hooks are called, the message has been marked deleted but is
still the current message in the Rmail buffer.Vrmail-file-coding-system
Coding system used in RMAIL file.

This is set to nil by default.Vrmail-enable-mime
*If non-nil, RMAIL uses MIME feature.
If the value is t, RMAIL automatically shows MIME decoded message.
If the value is neither t nor nil, RMAIL does not show MIME decoded message
until a user explicitly requires it.Vrmail-show-mime-function
Function to show MIME decoded message of RMAIL file.
This function is called when `rmail-enable-mime' is non-nil.
It is called with no argument.Vrmail-insert-mime-forwarded-message-function
Function to insert a message in MIME format so it can be forwarded.
This function is called if `rmail-enable-mime' or 
`rmail-enable-mime-composing' is non-nil.
It is called with one argument FORWARD-BUFFER, which is a
buffer containing the message to forward.  The current buffer
is the outgoing mail buffer.Vrmail-insert-mime-resent-message-function
Function to insert a message in MIME format so it can be resent.
This function is called if `rmail-enable-mime' is non-nil.
It is called with one argument FORWARD-BUFFER, which is a
buffer containing the message to forward.  The current buffer
is the outgoing mail buffer.Vrmail-search-mime-message-function
Function to check if a regexp matches a MIME message.
This function is called if `rmail-enable-mime' is non-nil.
It is called with two arguments MSG and REGEXP, where
MSG is the message number, REGEXP is the regular expression.Vrmail-search-mime-header-function
Function to check if a regexp matches a header of MIME message.
This function is called if `rmail-enable-mime' is non-nil.
It is called with four arguments MSG, REGEXP, and LIMIT, where
MSG is the message number,
REGEXP is the regular expression,
LIMIT is the position specifying the end of header.Vrmail-mime-feature
Feature to require to load MIME support in Rmail.
When starting Rmail, if `rmail-enable-mime' is non-nil,
this feature is required with `require'.Vrmail-decode-mime-charset
*Non-nil means a message is decoded by MIME's charset specification.
If this variable is nil, or the message has not MIME specification,
the message is decoded as normal way.

If the variable `rmail-enable-mime' is non-nil, this variables is
ignored, and all the decoding work is done by a feature specified by
the variable `rmail-mime-feature'.Vrmail-mime-charset-pattern
Regexp to match MIME-charset specification in a header of message.
The first parenthesized expression should match the MIME-charset name.Frmail
Read and edit incoming mail.
Moves messages into file named by `rmail-file-name' (a babyl format file)
 and edits that file in RMAIL Mode.
Type \[describe-mode] once editing that file, for a list of RMAIL commands.

May be called with file name as argument; then performs rmail editing on
that file, but does not copy any new mail into the file.
Interactively, if you supply a prefix argument, then you
have a chance to specify a file name with the minibuffer.

If `rmail-display-summary' is non-nil, make a summary for this RMAIL file.Frmail-mode

When called from lisp code, N may be omitted.

If the pruned message header is shown on the current message, then
messages will be appended with pruned headers; otherwise, messages
will be appended with their original headers.

The default file name comes from `rmail-default-file',
which is updated to the name you use in this command.

but if PRIMARY-ONLY is non-nil (prefix arg given),
 only look in the To and From fields.
RECIPIENTS is a string of regexps separated by commas.Frmail-summary-by-regexp
Display a summary of all messages according to regexp REGEXP.
If the regular expression is found in the header of the message
(including in the date and other lines, as well as the subject line),
Emacs will list the header line in the RMAIL-summary.Frmail-summary-by-topic

when receiving new mail.  If it matches the address of the sender,
the recipient is taken as correspondent of a mail.
If nil (default value), your `user-login-name' and `user-mail-address'
are used to exclude yourself as correspondent.

Usually you don't have to set this variable, except if you collect mails
sent by you under different user names.
Then it should be a regexp matching your mail adresses.

Setting this variable has an effect only before reading a mail.Fnews-post-news

`(not (category CATEGORY))'
     matches a character that has not category CATEGORY.

`(and SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
     matches what SEXP1 matches, followed by what SEXP2 matches, etc.

`(submatch SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
     like `and', but makes the match accessible with `match-end',
     `match-beginning', and `match-string'.

`(group SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
     another name for `submatch'.

`(or SEXP1 SEXP2 ...)'
     matches anything that matches SEXP1 or SEXP2, etc.  If all
     args are strings, use `regexp-opt' to optimize the resulting
     regular expression.

`(minimal-match SEXP)'
     produce a non-greedy regexp for SEXP.  Normally, regexps matching
     zero or more occurrances of something are "greedy" in that they
     match as much as they can, as long as the overall regexp can
     still match.  A non-greedy regexp matches as little as possible.

`(maximal-match SEXP)'
     produce a greedy regexp for SEXP.   This is the default.

`(zero-or-more SEXP)'
     matches zero or more occurrences of what SEXP matches.

`(0+ SEXP)'
     like `zero-or-more'.

`(* SEXP)'
     like `zero-or-more', but always produces a greedy regexp.

`(*? SEXP)'
     like `zero-or-more', but always produces a non-greedy regexp.

`(one-or-more SEXP)'
     matches one or more occurrences of A.
  
`(1+ SEXP)'
     like `one-or-more'.

`(+ SEXP)'
     like `one-or-more', but always produces a greedy regexp.

`(+? SEXP)'
     like `one-or-more', but always produces a non-greedy regexp.

`(zero-or-one SEXP)'
     matches zero or one occurrences of A.
     
`(optional SEXP)'
     like `zero-or-one'.

`(? SEXP)'
     like `zero-or-one', but always produces a greedy regexp.

`(?? SEXP)'
     like `zero-or-one', but always produces a non-greedy regexp.

`(repeat N SEXP)'
     matches N occurrences of what SEXP matches.

`(repeat N M SEXP)'
     matches N to M occurrences of what SEXP matches.

`(eval FORM)'
      evaluate FORM and insert result.   If result is a string,
      `regexp-quote' it.

`(regexp REGEXP)'
      include REGEXP in string notation in the result.Fscheme-mode
Major mode for editing Scheme code.
Editing commands are similar to those of `lisp-mode'.

In addition, if an inferior Scheme process is running, some additional
commands will be defined, for evaluating expressions and controlling
the interpreter, and the state of the process will be displayed in the
modeline of all Scheme buffers.  The names of commands that interact
with the Scheme process start with "xscheme-" if you use the MIT
Scheme-specific `xscheme' package; for more information see the
documentation for `xscheme-interaction-mode'.  Use \[run-scheme] to
start an inferior Scheme using the more general `cmuscheme' package.

Commands:
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.
Blank lines separate paragraphs.  Semicolons start comments.
\{scheme-mode-map}
Entry to this mode calls the value of `scheme-mode-hook'
if that value is non-nil.Fdsssl-mode
Major mode for editing DSSSL code.
Editing commands are similar to those of `lisp-mode'.

Commands:
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.
Blank lines separate paragraphs.  Semicolons start comments.
\{scheme-mode-map}
Entering this mode runs the hooks `scheme-mode-hook' and then
`dsssl-mode-hook' and inserts the value of `dsssl-sgml-declaration' if
that variable's value is a string.Fgnus-score-mode
Mode for editing Gnus score files.
This mode is an extended emacs-lisp mode.

\{gnus-score-mode-map}Fscribe-mode
Major mode for editing files of Scribe (a text formatter) source.
Scribe-mode is similar to text-mode, with a few extra commands added.
\{scribe-mode-map}

Interesting variables:

scribe-fancy-paragraphs
  Non-nil makes Scribe mode use a different style of paragraph separation.

scribe-electric-quote
  Non-nil makes insert of double quote use `` or '' depending on context.

scribe-electric-parenthesis
  Non-nil makes an open-parenthesis char (one of `([<{')
  automatically insert its close if typed after an @Command form.Vscroll-all-mode
Control/track scroll locking.

Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either M-x customize or the function `scroll-all-mode'.Fscroll-all-mode
Toggle Scroll-All minor mode.Vmail-from-style
*Specifies how "From:" fields look.

If `nil', they contain just the return address like:
	king@grassland.com
If `parens', they look like:
	king@grassland.com (Elvis Parsley)
If `angles', they look like:
	Elvis Parsley <king@grassland.com>
If `system-default', allows the mailer to insert its default From field
derived from the envelope-from address.

In old versions of Emacs, the `system-default' setting also caused
Emacs to pass the proper email address from `user-mail-address'
to the mailer to specify the envelope-from address.  But that is now
controlled by a separate variable, `mail-specify-envelope-from'.Vmail-specify-envelope-from
*If non-nil, specify the envelope-from address when sending mail.
The value used to specify it is whatever is found in
`mail-envelope-from', with `user-mail-address' as fallback.

On most systems, specifying the envelope-from address
is a privileged operation.Vmail-self-blind
*Non-nil means insert BCC to self in messages to be sent.
This is done when the message is initialized,
so you can remove or alter the BCC field to override the default.Vmail-interactive
*Non-nil means when sending a message wait for and display errors.
nil means let mailer mail back a message to report errors.Vmail-yank-ignored-headers
*Delete these headers from old message when it's inserted in a reply.Vsend-mail-function
Function to call to send the current buffer as mail.
The headers should be delimited by a line which is
not a valid RFC822 header or continuation line,
that matches the variable `mail-header-separator'.
This is used by the default mail-sending commands.  See also
`message-send-mail-function' for use with the Message package.Vmail-header-separator
*Line used to separate headers from text in messages being composed.Vmail-archive-file-name
*Name of file to write all outgoing messages in, or nil for none.
This can be an inbox file or an Rmail file.Vmail-default-reply-to
*Address to insert as default Reply-to field of outgoing messages.
If nil, it will be initialized from the REPLYTO environment variable
when you first send mail.Vmail-alias-file
*If non-nil, the name of a file to use instead of `/usr/lib/aliases'.
This file defines aliases to be expanded by the mailer; this is a different
feature from that of defining aliases in `.mailrc' to be expanded in Emacs.
This variable has no effect unless your system uses sendmail as its mailer.Vmail-personal-alias-file
*If non-nil, the name of the user's personal mail alias file.
This file typically should be in same format as the `.mailrc' file used by
the `Mail' or `mailx' program.
This file need not actually exist.Vmail-signature
*Text inserted at end of mail buffer when a message is initialized.
If t, it means to insert the contents of the file `mail-signature-file'.
If a string, that string is inserted.
 (To make a proper signature, the string should begin with \n\n-- \n,
  which is the standard way to delimit a signature in a message.)
Otherwise, it should be an expression; it is evaluated
and should insert whatever you want to insert.Fmail-mode
Major mode for editing mail to be sent.
Like Text Mode but with these additional commands:
\[mail-send]  mail-send (send the message)    \[mail-send-and-exit]  mail-send-and-exit
Here are commands that move to a header field (and create it if there isn't):
	 \[mail-to]  move to To:	\[mail-subject]  move to Subject:
	 \[mail-cc]  move to CC:	\[mail-bcc]  move to BCC:
	 \[mail-fcc]  move to FCC:	\[mail-reply-to] move to Reply-To:
\[mail-text]  mail-text (move to beginning of message text).
\[mail-signature]  mail-signature (insert `mail-signature-file' file).
\[mail-yank-original]  mail-yank-original (insert current message, in Rmail).
\[mail-fill-yanked-message]  mail-fill-yanked-message (fill what was yanked).
\[mail-sent-via]  mail-sent-via (add a Sent-via field for each To or CC).
Turning on Mail mode runs the normal hooks `text-mode-hook' and
`mail-mode-hook' (in that order).Vsendmail-coding-system
*Coding system for encoding the outgoing mail.
This has higher priority than `default-buffer-file-coding-system'
and `default-sendmail-coding-system',
but lower priority than the local value of `buffer-file-coding-system'.
See also the function `select-message-coding-system'.Vdefault-sendmail-coding-system
Default coding system for encoding the outgoing mail.
This variable is used only when `sendmail-coding-system' is nil.

This variable is set/changed by the command set-language-environment.
User should not set this variable manually,
instead use sendmail-coding-system to get a constant encoding
of outgoing mails regardless of the current language environment.
See also the function `select-message-coding-system'.Fmail
Edit a message to be sent.  Prefix arg means resume editing (don't erase).
When this function returns, the buffer `*mail*' is selected.
The value is t if the message was newly initialized; otherwise, nil.

Optionally, the signature file `mail-signature-file' can be inserted at the
end; see the variable `mail-signature'.

\<mail-mode-map>
While editing message, type \[mail-send-and-exit] to send the message and exit.

Various special commands starting with C-c are available in sendmail mode
to move to message header fields:
\{mail-mode-map}

If `mail-self-blind' is non-nil, a BCC to yourself is inserted
when the message is initialized.

If `mail-default-reply-to' is non-nil, it should be an address (a string);
a Reply-to: field with that address is inserted.

If `mail-archive-file-name' is non-nil, an FCC field with that file name
is inserted.

The normal hook `mail-setup-hook' is run after the message is
initialized.  It can add more default fields to the message.

When calling from a program, the first argument if non-nil says
not to erase the existing contents of the `*mail*' buffer.

The second through fifth arguments,
 TO, SUBJECT, IN-REPLY-TO and CC, specify if non-nil
 the initial contents of those header fields.
 These arguments should not have final newlines.
The sixth argument REPLYBUFFER is a buffer which contains an
 original message being replied to, or else an action
 of the form (FUNCTION . ARGS) which says how to insert the original.
 Or it can be nil, if not replying to anything.
The seventh argument ACTIONS is a list of actions to take
 if/when the message is sent.  Each action looks like (FUNCTION . ARGS);
 when the message is sent, we apply FUNCTION to ARGS.
 This is how Rmail arranges to mark messages `answered'.Fmail-other-window
Like `mail' command, but display mail buffer in another window.Fmail-other-frame
Like `mail' command, but display mail buffer in another frame.Fserver-start
Allow this Emacs process to be a server for client processes.
This starts a server communications subprocess through which
client "editors" can send your editing commands to this Emacs job.
To use the server, set up the program `emacsclient' in the
Emacs distribution as your standard "editor".

Prefix arg means just kill any existing server communications subprocess.Fsgml-mode
Major mode for editing SGML documents.
Makes > match <.  Makes / blink matching /.
Keys <, &, SPC within <>, " and ' can be electric depending on
`sgml-quick-keys'.

An argument of N to a tag-inserting command means to wrap it around
the next N words.  In Transient Mark mode, when the mark is active,
N defaults to -1, which means to wrap it around the current region.

If you like upcased tags, put (setq sgml-transformation 'upcase) in
your `.emacs' file.

Use \[sgml-validate] to validate your document with an SGML parser.

Do \[describe-variable] sgml- SPC to see available variables.
Do \[describe-key] on the following bindings to discover what they do.
\{sgml-mode-map}Fhtml-mode
Major mode based on SGML mode for editing HTML documents.
This allows inserting skeleton constructs used in hypertext documents with
completion.  See below for an introduction to HTML.  Use
\[browse-url-of-buffer] to see how this comes out.  See also `sgml-mode' on
which this is based.

Do \[describe-variable] html- SPC and \[describe-variable] sgml- SPC to see available variables.

To write fairly well formatted pages you only need to know few things.  Most
browsers have a function to read the source code of the page being seen, so
you can imitate various tricks.  Here's a very short HTML primer which you
can also view with a browser to see what happens:

<title>A Title Describing Contents</title> should be on every page.  Pages can
have <h1>Very Major Headlines</h1> through <h6>Very Minor Headlines</h6>
<hr> Parts can be separated with horizontal rules.

<p>Paragraphs only need an opening tag.  Line breaks and multiple spaces are
ignored unless the text is <pre>preformatted.</pre>  Text can be marked as
<b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i> or <u>underlined</u> using the normal  M-g  or
Edit/Text Properties/Face commands.

Pages can have <a name="SOMENAME">named points</a> and can link other points
to them with <a href="#SOMENAME">see also somename</a>.  In the same way <a
href="URL">see also URL</a> where URL is a filename relative to current
directory, or absolute as in `http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html'.

Images in many formats can be inlined with <img src="URL">.

If you mainly create your own documents, `sgml-specials' might be
interesting.  But note that some HTML 2 browsers can't handle `&apos;'.
To work around that, do:
   (eval-after-load "sgml-mode" '(aset sgml-char-names ?' nil))

\{html-mode-map}Fsh-mode
Major mode for editing shell scripts.
This mode works for many shells, since they all have roughly the same syntax,
as far as commands, arguments, variables, pipes, comments etc. are concerned.
Unless the file's magic number indicates the shell, your usual shell is
assumed.  Since filenames rarely give a clue, they are not further analyzed.

This mode adapts to the variations between shells (see `sh-set-shell') by
means of an inheritance based feature lookup (see `sh-feature').  This
mechanism applies to all variables (including skeletons) that pertain to
shell-specific features.

The default style of this mode is that of Rosenblatt's Korn shell book.
The syntax of the statements varies with the shell being used.  The
following commands are available, based on the current shell's syntax:

\[sh-case]	 case statement
\[sh-for]	 for loop
\[sh-function]	 function definition
\[sh-if]	 if statement
\[sh-indexed-loop]	 indexed loop from 1 to n
\[sh-while-getopts]	 while getopts loop
\[sh-repeat]	 repeat loop
\[sh-select]	 select loop
\[sh-until]	 until loop
\[sh-while]	 while loop

For sh and rc shells indentation commands are:
\[sh-show-indent]	Show the variable controlling this line's indentation.
\[sh-set-indent]	Set then variable controlling this line's indentation.
\[sh-learn-line-indent]	Change the indentation variable so this line
would indent to the way it currently is.
\[sh-learn-buffer-indent]  Set the indentation variables so the
buffer indents as it currently is indented.


\[backward-delete-char-untabify]	 Delete backward one position, even if it was a tab.
\[sh-newline-and-indent]	 Delete unquoted space and indent new line same as this one.
\[sh-end-of-command]	 Go to end of successive commands.
\[sh-beginning-of-command]	 Go to beginning of successive commands.
\[sh-set-shell]	 Set this buffer's shell, and maybe its magic number.
\[sh-execute-region]	 Have optional header and region be executed in a subshell.

\[sh-maybe-here-document]	 Without prefix, following an unquoted < inserts here document.
{, (, [, ', ", `
	Unless quoted with \, insert the pairs {}, (), [], or '', "", ``.

If you generally program a shell different from your login shell you can
set `sh-shell-file' accordingly.  If your shell's file name doesn't correctly
indicate what shell it is use `sh-alias-alist' to translate.

If your shell gives error messages with line numbers, you can use \[executable-interpret]
with your script for an edit-interpret-debug cycle.Flist-load-path-shadows
Display a list of Emacs Lisp files that shadow other files.

This function lists potential load-path problems.  Directories in the
`load-path' variable are searched, in order, for Emacs Lisp
files.  When a previously encountered file name is found again, a
message is displayed indicating that the later file is "hidden" by
the earlier.

For example, suppose `load-path' is set to

("/usr/gnu/emacs/site-lisp" "/usr/gnu/emacs/share/emacs/19.30/lisp")

and that each of these directories contains a file called XXX.el.  Then
XXX.el in the site-lisp directory is referred to by all of:
(require 'XXX), (autoload .... "XXX"), (load-library "XXX") etc.

The first XXX.el file prevents emacs from seeing the second (unless
the second is loaded explicitly via load-file).

When not intended, such shadowings can be the source of subtle
problems.  For example, the above situation may have arisen because the
XXX package was not distributed with versions of emacs prior to
19.30.  An emacs maintainer downloaded XXX from elsewhere and installed
it.  Later, XXX was updated and included in the emacs distribution.
Unless the emacs maintainer checks for this, the new version of XXX
will be hidden behind the old (which may no longer work with the new
emacs version).

This function performs these checks and flags all possible
shadowings.  Because a .el file may exist without a corresponding .elc
(or vice-versa), these suffixes are essentially ignored.  A file
XXX.elc in an early directory (that does not contain XXX.el) is
considered to shadow a later file XXX.el, and vice-versa.

When run interactively, the shadowings (if any) are displayed in a
buffer called `*Shadows*'.  Shadowings are located by calling the
(non-interactive) companion function, `find-emacs-lisp-shadows'.Fshadow-define-cluster
Edit (or create) the definition of a cluster NAME.
This is a group of hosts that share directories, so that copying to or from
one of them is sufficient to update the file on all of them.  Clusters are
defined by a name, the network address of a primary host (the one we copy
files to), and a regular expression that matches the hostnames of all the sites
in the cluster.Fshadow-define-literal-group
Declare a single file to be shared between sites.
It may have different filenames on each site.  When this file is edited, the
new version will be copied to each of the other locations.  Sites can be
specific hostnames, or names of clusters (see `shadow-define-cluster').Fshadow-define-regexp-group
Make each of a group of files be shared between hosts.
Prompts for regular expression; files matching this are shared between a list
of sites, which are also prompted for.  The filenames must be identical on all
hosts (if they aren't, use shadow-define-group instead of this function).
Each site can be either a hostname or the name of a cluster (see
`shadow-define-cluster').Fshadow-initialize
Set up file shadowing.Vshell-dumb-shell-regexp
Regexp to match shells that don't save their command history, and
don't handle the backslash as a quote character.  For shells that
match this regexp, Emacs will write out the command history when the
shell finishes, and won't remove backslashes when it unquotes shell
arguments.Fshell
Run an inferior shell, with I/O through BUFFER (which defaults to `*shell*').
Interactively, a prefix arg means to prompt for BUFFER.
If BUFFER exists but shell process is not running, make new shell.
If BUFFER exists and shell process is running, just switch to BUFFER.
Program used comes from variable `explicit-shell-file-name',
 or (if that is nil) from the ESHELL environment variable,
 or else from SHELL if there is no ESHELL.
If a file `~/.emacs_SHELLNAME' exists, it is given as initial input
 (Note that this may lose due to a timing error if the shell
  discards input when it starts up.)
The buffer is put in Shell mode, giving commands for sending input
and controlling the subjobs of the shell.  See `shell-mode'.
See also the variable `shell-prompt-pattern'.

To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the shell, use \[universal-coding-system-argument]
before \[shell].  You can also specify this with \[set-buffer-process-coding-system]
in the shell buffer, after you start the shell.
The default comes from `process-coding-system-alist' and
`default-process-coding-system'.

The shell file name (sans directories) is used to make a symbol name
such as `explicit-csh-args'.  If that symbol is a variable,
its value is used as a list of arguments when invoking the shell.
Otherwise, one argument `-i' is passed to the shell.

(Type \[describe-mode] in the shell buffer for a list of commands.)Fsimula-mode
Major mode for editing SIMULA code.
\{simula-mode-map}
Variables controlling indentation style:
 simula-tab-always-indent
    Non-nil means TAB in SIMULA mode should always reindent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 simula-indent-level
    Indentation of SIMULA statements with respect to containing block.
 simula-substatement-offset
    Extra indentation after DO, THEN, ELSE, WHEN and OTHERWISE.
 simula-continued-statement-offset 3
    Extra indentation for lines not starting a statement or substatement,
    e.g. a nested FOR-loop.  If value is a list, each line in a multiple-
    line continued statement will have the car of the list extra indentation
    with respect to the previous line of the statement.
 simula-label-offset -4711
    Offset of SIMULA label lines relative to usual indentation.
 simula-if-indent '(0 . 0)
    Extra indentation of THEN and ELSE with respect to the starting IF.
    Value is a cons cell, the car is extra THEN indentation and the cdr
    extra ELSE indentation.  IF after ELSE is indented as the starting IF.
 simula-inspect-indent '(0 . 0)
    Extra indentation of WHEN and OTHERWISE with respect to the
    corresponding INSPECT.  Value is a cons cell, the car is
    extra WHEN indentation and the cdr extra OTHERWISE indentation.
 simula-electric-indent nil
    If this variable is non-nil, `simula-indent-line'
    will check the previous line to see if it has to be reindented.
 simula-abbrev-keyword 'upcase
    Determine how SIMULA keywords will be expanded.  Value is one of
    the symbols `upcase', `downcase', `capitalize', (as in) `abbrev-table',
    or nil if they should not be changed.
 simula-abbrev-stdproc 'abbrev-table
    Determine how standard SIMULA procedure and class names will be
    expanded.  Value is one of the symbols `upcase', `downcase', `capitalize',
    (as in) `abbrev-table', or nil if they should not be changed.

Turning on SIMULA mode calls the value of the variable simula-mode-hook
with no arguments, if that value is non-nil

Warning: simula-mode-hook should not read in an abbrev file without calling
the function simula-install-standard-abbrevs afterwards, preferably not
at all.Vskeleton-filter
Function for transforming a skeleton proxy's aliases' variable value.Fdefine-skeleton
Define a user-configurable COMMAND that enters a statement skeleton.
DOCUMENTATION is that of the command, while the variable of the same name,
which contains the skeleton, has a documentation to that effect.
INTERACTOR and ELEMENT ... are as defined under `skeleton-insert'.Fskeleton-proxy-new
Insert skeleton defined by variable of same name (see `skeleton-insert').
Prefix ARG allows wrapping around words or regions (see `skeleton-insert').
If no ARG was given, but the region is visible, ARG defaults to -1 depending
on `skeleton-autowrap'.  An ARG of  M-0  will prevent this just for once.
This command can also be an abbrev expansion (3rd and 4th columns in
\[edit-abbrevs]  buffer: ""  command-name).

When called as a function, optional first argument STR may also be a string
which will be the value of `str' whereas the skeleton's interactor is then
ignored.Fskeleton-proxy
Insert skeleton defined by variable of same name (see `skeleton-insert').
Prefix ARG allows wrapping around words or regions (see `skeleton-insert').
If no ARG was given, but the region is visible, ARG defaults to -1 depending
on `skeleton-autowrap'.  An ARG of  M-0  will prevent this just for once.
This command can also be an abbrev expansion (3rd and 4th columns in
\[edit-abbrevs]  buffer: ""  command-name).

When called as a function, optional first argument STR may also be a string
which will be the value of `str' whereas the skeleton's interactor is then
ignored.Fskeleton-insert
Insert the complex statement skeleton SKELETON describes very concisely.

With optional second argument REGIONS, wrap first interesting point
(`_') in skeleton around next REGIONS words, if REGIONS is positive.
If REGIONS is negative, wrap REGIONS preceding interregions into first
REGIONS interesting positions (successive `_'s) in skeleton.

An interregion is the stretch of text between two contiguous marked
points.  If you marked A B C [] (where [] is the cursor) in
alphabetical order, the 3 interregions are simply the last 3 regions.
But if you marked B A [] C, the interregions are B-A, A-[], []-C.

The optional third argument STR, if specified, is the value for the
variable `str' within the skeleton.  When this is non-nil, the
interactor gets ignored, and this should be a valid skeleton element.

SKELETON is made up as (INTERACTOR ELEMENT ...).  INTERACTOR may be nil if
not needed, a prompt-string or an expression for complex read functions.

If ELEMENT is a string or a character it gets inserted (see also
`skeleton-transformation').  Other possibilities are:

	\n	go to next line and indent according to mode
	_	interesting point, interregion here
	>	indent line (or interregion if > _) according to major mode
	@	add position to `skeleton-positions'
	&	do next ELEMENT iff previous moved point
	|	do next ELEMENT iff previous didn't move point
	-num	delete num preceding characters (see `skeleton-untabify')
	resume:	skipped, continue here if quit is signaled
	nil	skipped

After termination, point will be positioned at the first occurrence
of _ or @ or at the end of the inserted text.

Further elements can be defined via `skeleton-further-elements'.  ELEMENT may
itself be a SKELETON with an INTERACTOR.  The user is prompted repeatedly for
different inputs.  The SKELETON is processed as often as the user enters a
non-empty string.  \[keyboard-quit] terminates skeleton insertion, but
continues after `resume:' and positions at `_' if any.  If INTERACTOR in such
a subskeleton is a prompt-string which contains a ".. %s .." it is
formatted with `skeleton-subprompt'.  Such an INTERACTOR may also be a list of
strings with the subskeleton being repeated once for each string.

Quoted Lisp expressions are evaluated for their side-effects.
Other Lisp expressions are evaluated and the value treated as above.
Note that expressions may not return `t' since this implies an
endless loop.  Modes can define other symbols by locally setting them
to any valid skeleton element.  The following local variables are
available:

	str	first time: read a string according to INTERACTOR
		then: insert previously read string once more
	help	help-form during interaction with the user or `nil'
	input	initial input (string or cons with index) while reading str
	v1, v2	local variables for memorizing anything you want

When done with skeleton, but before going back to `_'-point call
`skeleton-end-hook' if that is non-`nil'.Fskeleton-pair-insert-maybe
Insert the character you type ARG times.

With no ARG, if `skeleton-pair' is non-nil, pairing can occur.  If the region
is visible the pair is wrapped around it depending on `skeleton-autowrap'.
Else, if `skeleton-pair-on-word' is non-nil or we are not before or inside a
word, and if `skeleton-pair-filter' returns nil, pairing is performed.
Pairing is also prohibited if we are right after a quoting character
such as backslash.

If a match is found in `skeleton-pair-alist', that is inserted, else
the defaults are used.  These are (), [], {}, <> and `' for the
symmetrical ones, and the same character twice for the others.Fsmerge-mode

(The variable `solitaire-auto-eval' controls whether to automatically
check after each move or undo)

What is Solitaire?

I don't know who invented this game, but it seems to be rather old and
its origin seems to be northern Africa.  Here's how to play:
Initially, the board will look similar to this:

	Le Solitaire             
	============             
	
		o   o   o        
	
		o   o   o        
	
	o   o   o   o   o   o   o
	
	o   o   o   .   o   o   o
	
	o   o   o   o   o   o   o
	
		o   o   o        
	
		o   o   o        

Let's call the o's stones and the .'s holes.  One stone fits into one
hole.  As you can see, all holes but one are occupied by stones.  The
aim of the game is to get rid of all but one stone, leaving that last
one in the middle of the board if you're cool.

A stone can be moved if there is another stone next to it, and a hole
after that one.  Thus there must be three fields in a row, either
horizontally or vertically, up, down, left or right, which look like
this:  o  o  .

Then the first stone is moved to the hole, jumping over the second,
which therefore is taken away.  The above thus `evaluates' to:  .  .  o

That's all.  Here's the board after two moves:

		o   o   o        
	
		.   o   o        
	
	o   o   .   o   o   o   o
	
	o   .   o   o   o   o   o
	
	o   o   o   o   o   o   o
	
		o   o   o        
	
		o   o   o

\{solitaire-mode-map}Fsort-subr
General text sorting routine to divide buffer into records and sort them.
Arguments are REVERSE NEXTRECFUN ENDRECFUN &optional STARTKEYFUN ENDKEYFUN.

We divide the accessible portion of the buffer into disjoint pieces
called sort records.  A portion of each sort record (perhaps all of
it) is designated as the sort key.  The records are rearranged in the
buffer in order by their sort keys.  The records may or may not be
contiguous.

Usually the records are rearranged in order of ascending sort key.
If REVERSE is non-nil, they are rearranged in order of descending sort key.
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order.

The next four arguments are functions to be called to move point
across a sort record.  They will be called many times from within sort-subr.

NEXTRECFUN is called with point at the end of the previous record.
It moves point to the start of the next record.
It should move point to the end of the buffer if there are no more records.
The first record is assumed to start at the position of point when sort-subr
is called.

ENDRECFUN is called with point within the record.
It should move point to the end of the record.

STARTKEYFUN moves from the start of the record to the start of the key.
It may return either a non-nil value to be used as the key, or
else the key is the substring between the values of point after
STARTKEYFUN and ENDKEYFUN are called.  If STARTKEYFUN is nil, the key
starts at the beginning of the record.

ENDKEYFUN moves from the start of the sort key to the end of the sort key.
ENDKEYFUN may be nil if STARTKEYFUN returns a value or if it would be the
same as ENDRECFUN.Fsort-lines
Sort lines in region alphabetically; argument means descending order.
Called from a program, there are three arguments:
REVERSE (non-nil means reverse order), BEG and END (region to sort).
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order.Fsort-paragraphs
Sort paragraphs in region alphabetically; argument means descending order.
Called from a program, there are three arguments:
REVERSE (non-nil means reverse order), BEG and END (region to sort).
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order.Fsort-pages
Sort pages in region alphabetically; argument means descending order.
Called from a program, there are three arguments:
REVERSE (non-nil means reverse order), BEG and END (region to sort).
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order.Fsort-numeric-fields
Sort lines in region numerically by the ARGth field of each line.
Fields are separated by whitespace and numbered from 1 up.
Specified field must contain a number in each line of the region,
which may begin with "0x" or "0" for hexadecimal and octal values.
Otherwise, the number is interpreted according to sort-numeric-base.
With a negative arg, sorts by the ARGth field counted from the right.
Called from a program, there are three arguments:
FIELD, BEG and END.  BEG and END specify region to sort.Fsort-fields
Sort lines in region lexicographically by the ARGth field of each line.
Fields are separated by whitespace and numbered from 1 up.
With a negative arg, sorts by the ARGth field counted from the right.
Called from a program, there are three arguments:
FIELD, BEG and END.  BEG and END specify region to sort.
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order.Fsort-regexp-fields
Sort the region lexicographically as specified by RECORD-REGEXP and KEY.
RECORD-REGEXP specifies the textual units which should be sorted.
  For example, to sort lines RECORD-REGEXP would be "^.*$"
KEY specifies the part of each record (ie each match for RECORD-REGEXP)
  is to be used for sorting.
  If it is "\\digit" then the digit'th "\\(...\\)" match field from
  RECORD-REGEXP is used.
  If it is "\\&" then the whole record is used.
  Otherwise, it is a regular-expression for which to search within the record.
If a match for KEY is not found within a record then that record is ignored.

With a negative prefix arg sorts in reverse order.

The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order.

For example: to sort lines in the region by the first word on each line
 starting with the letter "f",
 RECORD-REGEXP would be "^.*$" and KEY would be "\\=\<f\\w*\\>"Fsort-columns
Sort lines in region alphabetically by a certain range of columns.
For the purpose of this command, the region BEG...END includes
the entire line that point is in and the entire line the mark is in.
The column positions of point and mark bound the range of columns to sort on.
A prefix argument means sort into REVERSE order.
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order.

Note that `sort-columns' rejects text that contains tabs,
because tabs could be split across the specified columns
and it doesn't know how to handle that.  Also, when possible,
it uses the `sort' utility program, which doesn't understand tabs.
Use \[untabify] to convert tabs to spaces before sorting.Freverse-region
Reverse the order of lines in a region.
From a program takes two point or marker arguments, BEG and END.Fspeedbar-frame-mode
Enable or disable speedbar.  Positive ARG means turn on, negative turn off.
nil means toggle.  Once the speedbar frame is activated, a buffer in
`speedbar-mode' will be displayed.  Currently, only one speedbar is
supported at a time.
`speedbar-before-popup-hook' is called before popping up the speedbar frame.
`speedbar-before-delete-hook' is called before the frame is deleted.Fspeedbar-get-focus
Change frame focus to or from the speedbar frame.
If the selected frame is not speedbar, then speedbar frame is
selected.  If the speedbar frame is active, then select the attached frame.Fspell-buffer
Check spelling of every word in the buffer.
For each incorrect word, you are asked for the correct spelling
and then put into a query-replace to fix some or all occurrences.
If you do not want to change a word, just give the same word
as its "correct" spelling; then the query replace is skipped.Fspell-word
Check spelling of word at or before point.
If it is not correct, ask user for the correct spelling
and `query-replace' the entire buffer to substitute it.Fspell-region
Like `spell-buffer' but applies only to region.
Used in a program, applies from START to END.
DESCRIPTION is an optional string naming the unit being checked:
for example, "word".Fspell-string
Check spelling of string supplied as argument.Fspook
Adds that special touch of class to your outgoing mail.Fsnarf-spooks
Return a vector containing the lines from `spook-phrases-file'.Fsql-help
Show short help for the SQL modes.

Use an entry function to open an interactive SQL buffer.  This buffer is
usually named `*SQL*'.  The name of the major mode is SQLi.

Use the following commands to start a specific SQL interpreter:

    PostGres: \[sql-postgres]
    MySQL: \[sql-mysql]

Other non-free SQL implementations are also supported:

    Solid: \[sql-solid]
    Oracle: \[sql-oracle]
    Informix: \[sql-informix]
    Sybase: \[sql-sybase]
    Ingres: \[sql-ingres]
    Microsoft: \[sql-ms]
    Interbase: \[sql-interbase]

But we urge you to choose a free implementation instead of these.

Once you have the SQLi buffer, you can enter SQL statements in the
buffer.  The output generated is appended to the buffer and a new prompt
is generated.  See the In/Out menu in the SQLi buffer for some functions
that help you navigate through the buffer, the input history, etc.

If you have a really complex SQL statement or if you are writing a
procedure, you can do this in a separate buffer.  Put the new buffer in
`sql-mode' by calling \[sql-mode].  The name of this buffer can be
anything.  The name of the major mode is SQL.

In this SQL buffer (SQL mode), you can send the region or the entire
buffer to the interactive SQL buffer (SQLi mode).  The results are
appended to the SQLi buffer without disturbing your SQL buffer.Fsql-mode
Major mode to edit SQL.

You can send SQL statements to the SQLi buffer using
\[sql-send-region].  Such a buffer must exist before you can do this.
See `sql-help' on how to create SQLi buffers.

\{sql-mode-map}
Customization: Entry to this mode runs the `sql-mode-hook'.

When you put a buffer in SQL mode, the buffer stores the last SQLi
buffer created as its destination in the variable `sql-buffer'.  This
will be the buffer \[sql-send-region] sends the region to.  If this
SQLi buffer is killed, \[sql-send-region] is no longer able to
determine where the strings should be sent to.  You can set the
value of `sql-buffer' using \[sql-set-sqli-buffer].

For information on how to create multiple SQLi buffers, see
`sql-interactive-mode'.Fsql-oracle

Setting this variable directly does not take effect.  Use either Customize
or M-x strokes-mode.Fstrokes-global-set-stroke
Interactively give STROKE the global binding as COMMAND.
Operated just like `global-set-key', except for strokes.
COMMAND is a symbol naming an interactively-callable function.  STROKE
is a list of sampled positions on the stroke grid as described in the
documentation for the `strokes-define-stroke' function.Fstrokes-read-stroke
Read a simple stroke (interactively) and return the stroke.
Optional PROMPT in minibuffer displays before and during stroke reading.
This function will display the stroke interactively as it is being
entered in the strokes buffer if the variable
`strokes-use-strokes-buffer' is non-nil.
Optional EVENT is acceptable as the starting event of the strokeFstrokes-read-complex-stroke
Read a complex stroke (interactively) and return the stroke.
Optional PROMPT in minibuffer displays before and during stroke reading.
Note that a complex stroke allows the user to pen-up and pen-down.  This
is implemented by allowing the user to paint with button1 or button2 and
then complete the stroke with button3.
Optional EVENT is acceptable as the starting event of the strokeFstrokes-do-stroke
Read a simple stroke from the user and then exectute its command.
This must be bound to a mouse event.Fstrokes-do-complex-stroke
Read a complex stroke from the user and then exectute its command.

Displays the command which STROKE maps to, reading STROKE interactively.Fstrokes-help
Get instructional help on using the `strokes' package.Fstrokes-load-user-strokes
Load user-defined strokes from file named by `strokes-file'.Fstrokes-list-strokes
Pop up a buffer containing an alphabetical listing of strokes in STROKES-MAP.
With CHRONOLOGICAL prefix arg (\[universal-argument]) list strokes
chronologically by command name.
If STROKES-MAP is not given, `strokes-global-map' will be used instead.Fstrokes-mode
Toggle strokes being enabled.
With ARG, turn strokes on if and only if ARG is positive or true.
Note that `strokes-mode' is a global mode.  Think of it as a minor
mode in all buffers when activated.
By default, strokes are invoked with mouse button-2.  You can define
new strokes with

> M-x global-set-stroke

To use strokes for pictographic editing, such as Chinese/Japanese, use
S-mouse-2, which draws strokes and inserts them.  Encode/decode your
strokes with

> M-x strokes-encode-buffer
> M-x strokes-decode-bufferFstrokes-decode-buffer
Decode stroke strings in BUFFER and display their corresponding glyphs.
Optional BUFFER defaults to the current buffer.
Optional FORCE non-nil will ignore the buffer's read-only status.Fstrokes-compose-complex-stroke
Read a complex stroke and insert its glyph into the current buffer.Fstudlify-region
Studlify-case the regionFstudlify-word
Studlify-case the current word, or COUNT words if given an argumentFsc-cite-original
Workhorse citing function which performs the initial citation.
This is callable from the various mail and news readers' reply
function according to the agreed upon standard.  See `\[sc-describe]'
for more details.  `sc-cite-original' does not do any yanking of the
original message but it does require a few things:

     1) The reply buffer is the current buffer.

     2) The original message has been yanked and inserted into the
        reply buffer.

     3) Verbose mail headers from the original message have been
        inserted into the reply buffer directly before the text of the
        original message.

     4) Point is at the beginning of the verbose headers.

     5) Mark is at the end of the body of text to be cited.

For Emacs 19's, the region need not be active (and typically isn't
when this function is called.  Also, the hook `sc-pre-hook' is run
before, and `sc-post-hook' is run after the guts of this function.Funtabify
Convert all tabs in region to multiple spaces, preserving columns.
Called non-interactively, the region is specified by arguments
START and END, rather than by the position of point and mark.
The variable `tab-width' controls the spacing of tab stops.Ftabify
Convert multiple spaces in region to tabs when possible.
A group of spaces is partially replaced by tabs
when this can be done without changing the column they end at.
Called non-interactively, the region is specified by arguments
START and END, rather than by the position of point and mark.
The variable `tab-width' controls the spacing of tab stops.Ftalk-connect
Connect to display DISPLAY for the Emacs talk group.Ftar-mode
Major mode for viewing a tar file as a dired-like listing of its contents.
You can move around using the usual cursor motion commands. 
Letters no longer insert themselves.
Type `e' to pull a file out of the tar file and into its own buffer;
or click mouse-2 on the file's line in the Tar mode buffer.
Type `c' to copy an entry from the tar file into another file on disk.

If you edit a sub-file of this archive (as with the `e' command) and 
save it with Control-x Control-s, the contents of that buffer will be 
saved back into the tar-file buffer; in this way you can edit a file 
inside of a tar archive without extracting it and re-archiving it.

See also: variables `tar-update-datestamp' and `tar-anal-blocksize'.
\{tar-mode-map}Ftcl-mode
Major mode for editing Tcl code.
Expression and list commands understand all Tcl brackets.
Tab indents for Tcl code.
Paragraphs are separated by blank lines only.
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.

Variables controlling indentation style:
  tcl-indent-level
    Indentation of Tcl statements within surrounding block.
  tcl-continued-indent-level
    Indentation of continuation line relative to first line of command.

Variables controlling user interaction with mode (see variable
documentation for details):
  tcl-tab-always-indent
    Controls action of TAB key.
  tcl-auto-newline
    Non-nil means automatically newline before and after braces, brackets,
    and semicolons inserted in Tcl code.
  tcl-electric-hash-style
    Controls action of `#' key.
  tcl-use-hairy-comment-detector
    If t, use more complicated, but slower, comment detector.
    This variable is only used in Emacs 19.
  tcl-use-smart-word-finder
    If not nil, use a smarter, Tcl-specific way to find the current
    word when looking up help on a Tcl command.

Turning on Tcl mode calls the value of the variable `tcl-mode-hook'
with no args, if that value is non-nil.  Read the documentation for
`tcl-mode-hook' to see what kinds of interesting hook functions
already exist.

Commands:
\{tcl-mode-map}Finferior-tcl
Run inferior Tcl process.
Prefix arg means enter program name interactively.
See documentation for function `inferior-tcl-mode' for more information.Ftcl-help-on-word
Get help on Tcl command.  Default is word at point.
Prefix argument means invert sense of `tcl-use-smart-word-finder'.Ftelnet
Open a network login connection to host named HOST (a string).
Communication with HOST is recorded in a buffer `*PROGRAM-HOST*'
where PROGRAM is the telnet program being used.  This program
is controlled by the contents of the global variable `telnet-host-properties',
falling back on the value of the global variable `telnet-program'.
Normally input is edited in Emacs and sent a line at a time.Frsh
Open a network login connection to host named HOST (a string).
Communication with HOST is recorded in a buffer `*rsh-HOST*'.
Normally input is edited in Emacs and sent a line at a time.Fmake-term
Make a term process NAME in a buffer, running PROGRAM.
The name of the buffer is made by surrounding NAME with `*'s.
If there is already a running process in that buffer, it is not restarted.
Optional third arg STARTFILE is the name of a file to send the contents of to
the process.  Any more args are arguments to PROGRAM.Fterm
Start a terminal-emulator in a new buffer.Fansi-term
Start a terminal-emulator in a new buffer.Fterminal-emulator
Under a display-terminal emulator in BUFFER, run PROGRAM on arguments ARGS.
ARGS is a list of argument-strings.  Remaining arguments are WIDTH and HEIGHT.
BUFFER's contents are made an image of the display generated by that program,
and any input typed when BUFFER is the current Emacs buffer is sent to that
program as keyboard input.

Interactively, BUFFER defaults to "*terminal*" and PROGRAM and ARGS
are parsed from an input-string using your usual shell.
WIDTH and HEIGHT are determined from the size of the current window
-- WIDTH will be one less than the window's width, HEIGHT will be its height.

To switch buffers and leave the emulator, or to give commands
to the emulator itself (as opposed to the program running under it),
type Control-^.  The following character is an emulator command.
Type Control-^ twice to send it to the subprogram.
This escape character may be changed using the variable `terminal-escape-char'.

`Meta' characters may not currently be sent through the terminal emulator.

Here is a list of some of the variables which control the behaviour
of the emulator -- see their documentation for more information:
terminal-escape-char, terminal-scrolling, terminal-more-processing,
terminal-redisplay-interval.

This function calls the value of terminal-mode-hook if that exists
and is non-nil after the terminal buffer has been set up and the
subprocess started.Ftetris
Play the Tetris game.
Shapes drop from the top of the screen, and the user has to move and
rotate the shape to fit in with those at the bottom of the screen so
as to form complete rows.

*Directory in which temporary files are written.
You can make this `/tmp' if your TEXINPUTS has no relative directories in it
and you don't try to apply \[tex-region] or \[tex-buffer] when there are
`\input' commands with relative directories.Vtex-first-line-header-regexp
Regexp for matching a first line which `tex-region' should include.
If this is non-nil, it should be a regular expression string;
if it matches the first line of the file,
`tex-region' always includes the first line in the TeX run.Vtex-main-file
*The main TeX source file which includes this buffer's file.
The command `tex-file' runs TeX on the file specified by `tex-main-file'
if the variable is non-nil.Vtex-offer-save
*If non-nil, ask about saving modified buffers before \[tex-file] is run.Vtex-run-command
*Command used to run TeX subjob.
TeX Mode sets `tex-command' to this string.

*Command used to run LaTeX subjob.
LaTeX Mode sets `tex-command' to this string.
See the documentation of that variable.Vslitex-run-command
*Command used to run SliTeX subjob.
SliTeX Mode sets `tex-command' to this string.
See the documentation of that variable.Vtex-start-options-string

otherwise, the file name, preceded by blank, is added at the end.Vtex-dvi-print-command
*Command used by \[tex-print] to print a .dvi file.
If this string contains an asterisk (`*'), that is replaced by the file name;
otherwise, the file name, preceded by blank, is added at the end.Vtex-alt-dvi-print-command
*Command used by \[tex-print] with a prefix arg to print a .dvi file.
If this string contains an asterisk (`*'), that is replaced by the file name;
otherwise, the file name, preceded by blank, is added at the end.

If two printers are not enough of a choice, you can set the variable
`tex-alt-dvi-print-command' to an expression that asks what you want;
for example,

    (setq tex-alt-dvi-print-command
         '(format "lpr -P%s" (read-string "Use printer: ")))

would tell \[tex-print] with a prefix argument to ask you which printer to
use.Vtex-dvi-view-command
*Command used by \[tex-view] to display a `.dvi' file.
If this string contains an asterisk (`*'), that is replaced by the file name;
otherwise, the file name, preceded by blank, is added at the end.

This can be set conditionally so that the previewer used is suitable for the
window system being used.  For example,

    (setq tex-dvi-view-command
          (if (eq window-system 'x) "xdvi" "dvi2tty * | cat -s"))

would tell \[tex-view] to use xdvi under X windows and to use dvi2tty
otherwise.Vtex-show-queue-command
*Command used by \[tex-show-print-queue] to show the print queue.
Should show the queue(s) that \[tex-print] puts jobs on.Vtex-default-mode

Tries to determine (by looking at the beginning of the file) whether
this file is for plain TeX, LaTeX, or SliTeX and calls `plain-tex-mode',
`latex-mode', or `slitex-mode', respectively.  If it cannot be determined,
such as if there are no commands in the file, the value of `tex-default-mode'
says which mode to use.Fplain-tex-mode

`tex-mode-hook', then the hook `latex-mode-hook', and finally the hook
`slitex-mode-hook'.  When the special subshell is initiated, the hook
`tex-shell-hook' is run.Ftexinfo-format-buffer
Process the current buffer as texinfo code, into an Info file.
The Info file output is generated in a buffer visiting the Info file
name specified in the @setfilename command.

Non-nil argument (prefix, if interactive) means don't make tag table
and don't split the file if large.  You can use Info-tagify and
Info-split to do these manually.Ftexinfo-format-region
Convert the current region of the Texinfo file to Info format.
This lets you see what that part of the file will look like in Info.
The command is bound to \[texinfo-format-region].  The text that is
converted to Info is stored in a temporary buffer.Ftexi2info
Convert the current buffer (written in Texinfo code) into an Info file.
The Info file output is generated in a buffer visiting the Info file
names specified in the @setfilename command.

This function automatically updates all node pointers and menus, and
creates a master menu.  This work is done on a temporary buffer that
is automatically removed when the Info file is created.  The original
Texinfo source buffer is not changed.

Non-nil argument (prefix, if interactive) means don't split the file
if large.  You can use Info-split to do this manually.Vtexinfo-open-quote
*String inserted by typing \[texinfo-insert-quote] to open a quotation.Vtexinfo-close-quote
*String inserted by typing \[texinfo-insert-quote] to close a quotation.Ftexinfo-mode
Major mode for editing Texinfo files.

  It has these extra commands:
\{texinfo-mode-map}

  These are files that are used as input for TeX to make printed manuals
and also to be turned into Info files with \[makeinfo-buffer] or
the `makeinfo' program.  These files must be written in a very restricted and
modified version of TeX input format.

  Editing commands are like text-mode except that the syntax table is
set up so expression commands skip Texinfo bracket groups.  To see
what the Info version of a region of the Texinfo file will look like,
use \[makeinfo-region], which runs `makeinfo' on the current region.

  You can show the structure of a Texinfo file with \[texinfo-show-structure].
This command shows the structure of a Texinfo file by listing the
lines with the @-sign commands for @chapter, @section, and the like.
These lines are displayed in another window called the *Occur* window.
In that window, you can position the cursor over one of the lines and
use \[occur-mode-goto-occurrence], to jump to the corresponding spot
in the Texinfo file.

  In addition, Texinfo mode provides commands that insert various
frequently used @-sign commands into the buffer.  You can use these
commands to save keystrokes.  And you can insert balanced braces with
\[texinfo-insert-braces] and later use the command \[up-list] to
move forward past the closing brace.

Also, Texinfo mode provides functions for automatically creating or
updating menus and node pointers.  These functions

  * insert the `Next', `Previous' and `Up' pointers of a node,
  * insert or update the menu for a section, and
  * create a master menu for a Texinfo source file.

Here are the functions:

    texinfo-update-node                \[texinfo-update-node]
    texinfo-every-node-update          \[texinfo-every-node-update]
    texinfo-sequential-node-update

    texinfo-make-menu                  \[texinfo-make-menu]
    texinfo-all-menus-update           \[texinfo-all-menus-update]
    texinfo-master-menu

    texinfo-indent-menu-description (column &optional region-p)

The `texinfo-column-for-description' variable specifies the column to
which menu descriptions are indented.

Passed an argument (a prefix argument, if interactive), the
`texinfo-update-node' and `texinfo-make-menu' functions do their jobs
in the region.

To use the updating commands, you must structure your Texinfo file
hierarchically, such that each `@node' line, with the exception of the
Top node, is accompanied by some kind of section line, such as an
`@chapter' or `@section' line.

If the file has a `top' node, it must be called `top' or `Top' and
be the first node in the file.


Entering Texinfo mode calls the value of `text-mode-hook', and then the
value of `texinfo-mode-hook'.Fthai-compose-region
Compose Thai characters in the region.
When called from a program, expects two arguments,
positions (integers or markers) specifying the region.Fthai-compose-string
Compose Thai characters in STRING and return the resulting string.Fthai-compose-buffer

`word', `sentence', `whitespace', `line', `page' and others.

See the file `thingatpt.el' for documentation on how to define
a symbol as a valid THING.

The value is a cons cell (START . END) giving the start and end positions
of the textual entity that was found.Fthing-at-point
Return the THING at point.
THING is a symbol which specifies the kind of syntactic entity you want.
Possibilities include `symbol', `list', `sexp', `defun', `filename', `url',

Add hard spaces in the current buffer.
See variables `tildify-pattern-alist', `tildify-string-alist', and
`tildify-ignored-environments-alist' for information about configuration
parameters.
This function performs no refilling of the changed text.Vdisplay-time-day-and-date
*Non-nil means \[display-time] should display day and date as well as time.Fdisplay-time
Enable display of time, load level, and mail flag in mode lines.
This display updates automatically every minute.
If `display-time-day-and-date' is non-nil, the current day and date
are displayed as well.
This runs the normal hook `display-time-hook' after each update.Vdisplay-time-mode
Non-nil if Display-Time mode is enabled.
See the command `display-time-mode' for a description of this minor-mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `display-time-mode'.Fdisplay-time-mode
Toggle display of time, load level, and mail flag in mode lines.
With a numeric arg, enable this display if arg is positive.

When this display is enabled, it updates automatically every minute.
If `display-time-day-and-date' is non-nil, the current day and date
are displayed as well.
This runs the normal hook `display-time-hook' after each update.Fdate-to-time
Convert DATE into time.Fsafe-date-to-time
Parse DATE and return a time structure.
If DATE is malformed, a zero time will be returned.Ftime-stamp
Update the time stamp string(s) in the buffer.
A template in a file can be automatically updated with a new time stamp
every time you save the file.  Add this line to your .emacs file:
    (add-hook 'write-file-hooks 'time-stamp)
Normally the template must appear in the first 8 lines of a file and
look like one of the following:
      Time-stamp: <>
      Time-stamp: " "
The time stamp is written between the brackets or quotes:
      Time-stamp: <1998-02-18 10:20:51 gildea>
The time stamp is updated only if the variable `time-stamp-active' is non-nil.
The format of the time stamp is set by the variable `time-stamp-format'.
The variables `time-stamp-line-limit', `time-stamp-start', `time-stamp-end',
`time-stamp-count', and `time-stamp-inserts-lines' control finding the
template.Ftime-stamp-toggle-active
Toggle `time-stamp-active', setting whether \[time-stamp] updates a buffer.
With arg, turn time stamping on if and only if arg is positive.Ftimeclock-modeline-display
Toggle display of the amount of time left today in the modeline.
If `timeclock-use-display-time' is non-nil, the modeline will be
updated whenever the time display is updated.  Otherwise, the
timeclock will use its own sixty second timer to do its updating.
With prefix ARG, turn modeline display on if and only if ARG is
positive.  Returns the new status of timeclock modeline display
(non-nil means on).Ftimeclock-in
Clock in, recording the current time moment in the timelog.
With a numeric prefix ARG, record the fact that today has only that
many hours in it to be worked.  If arg is a non-numeric prefix arg
(non-nil, but not a number), 0 is assumed (working on a holiday or
weekend).  *If not called interactively, ARG should be the number of
_seconds_ worked today*.  This feature only has effect the first time
this function is called within a day.

PROJECT as the project being clocked into.  If PROJECT is nil, and
FIND-PROJECT is non-nil -- or the user calls `timeclock-in'
interactively -- call the function `timeclock-get-project-function' to
discover the name of the project.Ftimeclock-out
Clock out, recording the current time moment in the timelog.
If a prefix ARG is given, the user has completed the project that was
begun during the last time segment.

REASON is the user's reason for clocking out.  If REASON is nil, and
FIND-REASON is non-nil -- or the user calls `timeclock-out'
interactively -- call the function `timeclock-get-reason-function' to
discover the reason.Ftimeclock-status-string
Report the overall timeclock status at the present moment.Ftimeclock-change
Change to working on a different project, by clocking in then out.
With a prefix ARG, consider the previous project as having been
finished at the time of changeover.  PROJECT is the name of the last
project you were working on.Ftimeclock-query-out
Ask the user before clocking out.
This is a useful function for adding to `kill-emacs-hook'.Ftimeclock-reread-log
Re-read the timeclock, to account for external changes.
Returns the new value of `timeclock-discrepancy'.Ftimeclock-workday-remaining-string
Return a string representing the amount of time left today.
Display second resolution if SHOW-SECONDS is non-nil.  If TODAY-ONLY
is non-nil, the display will be relative only to time worked today.
See `timeclock-relative' for more information about the meaning of
"relative to today".Ftimeclock-workday-elapsed-string
Return a string representing the amount of time worked today.
Display seconds resolution if SHOW-SECONDS is non-nil.  If RELATIVE is
non-nil, the amount returned will be relative to past time worked.Ftimeclock-when-to-leave-string
Return a string representing at what time the workday ends today.
This string is relative to the value of `timeclock-workday'.  If
NO-MESSAGE is non-nil, no messages will be displayed in the
minibuffer.  If SHOW-SECONDS is non-nil, the value printed/returned
will include seconds.  If TODAY-ONLY is non-nil, the value returned
will be relative only to the time worked today, and not to past time.
This argument only makes a difference if `timeclock-relative' is
non-nil.Fcancel-timer
Remove TIMER from the list of active timers.Fcancel-function-timers
Cancel all timers scheduled by `run-at-time' which would run FUNCTION.Frun-at-time
Perform an action at time TIME.
Repeat the action every REPEAT seconds, if REPEAT is non-nil.
TIME should be a string like "11:23pm", nil meaning now, a number of seconds
from now, a value from `current-time', or t (with non-nil REPEAT)
meaning the next integral multiple of REPEAT.
REPEAT may be an integer or floating point number.
The action is to call FUNCTION with arguments ARGS.

This function returns a timer object which you can use in `cancel-timer'.Frun-with-timer
Perform an action after a delay of SECS seconds.
Repeat the action every REPEAT seconds, if REPEAT is non-nil.
SECS and REPEAT may be integers or floating point numbers.
The action is to call FUNCTION with arguments ARGS.

This function returns a timer object which you can use in `cancel-timer'.Fadd-timeout
Add a timer to run SECS seconds from now, to call FUNCTION on OBJECT.
If REPEAT is non-nil, repeat the timer every REPEAT seconds.
This function is for compatibility; see also `run-with-timer'.Frun-with-idle-timer
Perform an action the next time Emacs is idle for SECS seconds.
The action is to call FUNCTION with arguments ARGS.
SECS may be an integer or a floating point number.

If REPEAT is non-nil, do the action each time Emacs has been idle for
exactly SECS seconds (that is, only once for each time Emacs becomes idle).

This function returns a timer object which you can use in `cancel-timer'.Fwith-timeout
Run BODY, but if it doesn't finish in SECONDS seconds, give up.
If we give up, we run the TIMEOUT-FORMS and return the value of the last one.
The call should look like:
 (with-timeout (SECONDS TIMEOUT-FORMS...) BODY...)
The timeout is checked whenever Emacs waits for some kind of external
event (such as keyboard input, input from subprocesses, or a certain time);
if the program loops without waiting in any way, the timeout will not
be detected.Ftitdic-convert
Convert a TIT dictionary of FILENAME into a Quail package.
Optional argument DIRNAME if specified is the directory name under which
the generated Quail package is saved.Fbatch-titdic-convert
Run `titdic-convert' on the files remaining on the command line.
Use this from the command line, with `-batch';
it won't work in an interactive Emacs.
For example, invoke "emacs -batch -f batch-titdic-convert XXX.tit" to
 generate Quail package file "xxx.el" from TIT dictionary file "XXX.tit".
To get complete usage, invoke "emacs -batch -f batch-titdic-convert -h".Ftmm-menubar
Text-mode emulation of looking and choosing from a menubar.
See the documentation for `tmm-prompt'.
X-POSITION, if non-nil, specifies a horizontal position within the menu bar;
we make that menu bar item (the one at that position) the default choice.Ftmm-menubar-mouse
Text-mode emulation of looking and choosing from a menubar.
This command is used when you click the mouse in the menubar
on a console which has no window system but does have a mouse.
See the documentation for `tmm-prompt'.Ftmm-prompt
Text-mode emulation of calling the bindings in keymap.
Creates a text-mode menu of possible choices.  You can access the elements
in the menu in two ways:
   *)  via history mechanism from minibuffer;
   *)  Or via completion-buffer that is automatically shown.
The last alternative is currently a hack, you cannot use mouse reliably.

MENU is like the MENU argument to `x-popup-menu': either a
keymap or an alist of alists.
DEFAULT-ITEM, if non-nil, specifies an initial default choice.
Its value should be an event that has a binding in MENU.Ftodo-add-category
Add new category CAT to the TODO list.Ftodo-add-item-non-interactively
Insert NEW-ITEM in TODO list as a new entry in CATEGORY.Ftodo-insert-item
Insert new TODO list entry.
With a prefix argument solicit the category, otherwise use the current
category.Ftodo-top-priorities
List top priorities for each category.

Number of entries for each category is given by NOF-PRIORITIES which
defaults to 'todo-show-priorities'.

If CATEGORY-PR-PAGE is non-nil, a page separator '^L' is inserted
between each category.Ftodo-print
Print todo summary using `todo-print-function'.
If CATEGORY-PR-PAGE is non-nil, a page separator `^L' is inserted
between each category.

Number of entries for each category is given by `todo-print-priorities'.Ftodo-mode
Major mode for editing TODO lists.

\{todo-mode-map}Ftodo-cp
Make a diary entry appear only in the current date's diary.Ftodo-show
Show TODO list.Vtool-bar-mode
Non-nil if Tool-Bar mode is enabled.
See the command `tool-bar-mode' for a description of this minor-mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `tool-bar-mode'.Ftool-bar-mode
Toggle use of the tool bar.
With numeric ARG, display the tool bar if and only if ARG is positive.

See `tool-bar-add-item' and `tool-bar-add-item-from-menu' for
conveniently adding tool bar items.Ftool-bar-add-item
Add an item to the tool bar.
ICON names the image, DEF is the key definition and KEY is a symbol
for the fake function key in the menu keymap.  Remaining arguments
PROPS are additional items to add to the menu item specification.  See
Info node `(elisp)Tool Bar'.  Items are added from left to right.

ICON is the base name of a file containing the image to use.  The
function will first try to use ICON.xpm, then ICON.pbm, and finally
ICON.xbm, using `find-image'.

Keybindings are made in the map `tool-bar-map'.  To define items in
some local map, bind `tool-bar-map' with `let' around calls of this
function.Ftool-bar-add-item-from-menu
Define tool bar binding for COMMAND using the given ICON in keymap MAP.
The binding of COMMAND is looked up in the menu bar in MAP (default
`global-map') and modified to add an image specification for ICON, which
is looked for as by `tool-bar-add-item'.
MAP must contain an appropriate keymap bound to `[menu-bar]'.
PROPS is a list of additional properties to add to the binding.

Keybindings are made in the map `tool-bar-map'.  To define items in
some local map, bind `tool-bar-map' with `let' around calls of this
function.Ftooltip-mode
Mode for tooltip display.
With ARG, turn tooltip mode on if and only if ARG is positive.Vtooltip-mode
Toggle tooltip-mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `tooltip-mode'.Ftpu-edt-on
Turn on TPU/edt emulation.Ftpu-set-scroll-margins
Set scroll margins.Ftpu-set-cursor-free
Allow the cursor to move freely about the screen.Ftpu-set-cursor-bound
Constrain the cursor to the flow of the text.Ftq-create
Create and return a transaction queue communicating with PROCESS.
PROCESS should be a subprocess capable of sending and receiving
streams of bytes.  It may be a local process, or it may be connected
to a tcp server on another machine.Vtrace-buffer
*Trace output will by default go to that buffer.Ftrace-function
Traces FUNCTION with trace output going to BUFFER.
For every call of FUNCTION Lisp-style trace messages that display argument
and return values will be inserted into BUFFER. This function generates the
trace advice for FUNCTION and activates it together with any other advice
there might be!! The trace BUFFER will popup whenever FUNCTION is called.
Do not use this to trace functions that switch buffers or do any other
display oriented stuff, use `trace-function-background' instead.Ftrace-function-background
Traces FUNCTION with trace output going quietly to BUFFER.
For every call of FUNCTION Lisp-style trace messages that display argument
and return values will be inserted into BUFFER. This function generates the
trace advice for FUNCTION and activates it together with any other advice
there might be!! Trace output will quietly go to BUFFER without changing
the window or buffer configuration at all.F2C-two-columns
Split current window vertically for two-column editing.
When called the first time, associates a buffer with the current
buffer in two-column minor mode (see  \[describe-mode] ).
Runs `2C-other-buffer-hook' in the new buffer.
When called again, restores the screen layout with the current buffer
first and the associated buffer to its right.F2C-associate-buffer
Associate another buffer with this one in two-column minor mode.
Can also be used to associate a just previously visited file, by
accepting the proposed default buffer.

(See  \[describe-mode] .)F2C-split
Split a two-column text at point, into two buffers in two-column minor mode.
Point becomes the local value of `2C-window-width'.  Only lines that
have the ARG same preceding characters at that column get split.  The
ARG preceding characters without any leading whitespace become the local
value for `2C-separator'.  This way lines that continue across both
columns remain untouched in the first buffer.

This function can be used with a prototype line, to set up things.  You
write the first line of each column and then split that line.  E.g.:

First column's text    sSs  Second column's text
		       \___/\
			/    \
   5 character Separator      You type  M-5 \[2C-split]  with the point here.

(See  \[describe-mode] .)Vtype-break-mode
Toggle typing break mode.
See the docstring for the `type-break-mode' command for more information.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `type-break-mode'.Vtype-break-interval
*Number of seconds between scheduled typing breaks.Vtype-break-good-rest-interval
*Number of seconds of idle time considered to be an adequate typing rest.

When this variable is non-`nil', emacs checks the idle time between
keystrokes.  If this idle time is long enough to be considered a "good"
rest from typing, then the next typing break is simply rescheduled for later.

If a break is interrupted before this much time elapses, the user will be
asked whether or not really to interrupt the break.Vtype-break-keystroke-threshold
*Upper and lower bound on number of keystrokes for considering typing break.
This structure is a pair of numbers (MIN . MAX).

The first number is the minimum number of keystrokes that must have been
entered since the last typing break before considering another one, even if
the scheduled time has elapsed; the break is simply rescheduled until later
if the minimum threshold hasn't been reached.  If this first value is nil,
then there is no minimum threshold; as soon as the scheduled time has
elapsed, the user will always be queried.

The second number is the maximum number of keystrokes that can be entered
before a typing break is requested immediately, pre-empting the originally
scheduled break.  If this second value is nil, then no pre-emptive breaks
will occur; only scheduled ones will.

Keys with bucky bits (shift, control, meta, etc) are counted as only one
keystroke even though they really require multiple keys to generate them.

The command `type-break-guesstimate-keystroke-threshold' can be used to
guess a reasonably good pair of values for this variable.Ftype-break-mode
Enable or disable typing-break mode.
This is a minor mode, but it is global to all buffers by default.

When this mode is enabled, the user is encouraged to take typing breaks at
appropriate intervals; either after a specified amount of time or when the
user has exceeded a keystroke threshold.  When the time arrives, the user
is asked to take a break.  If the user refuses at that time, emacs will ask
again in a short period of time.  The idea is to give the user enough time
to find a good breaking point in his or her work, but be sufficiently
annoying to discourage putting typing breaks off indefinitely.

A negative prefix argument disables this mode.
No argument or any non-negative argument enables it.

The user may enable or disable this mode by setting the variable of the
same name, though setting it in that way doesn't reschedule a break or
reset the keystroke counter.

If the mode was previously disabled and is enabled as a consequence of
calling this function, it schedules a break with `type-break-schedule' to
make sure one occurs (the user can call that command to reschedule the
break at any time).  It also initializes the keystroke counter.

The variable `type-break-interval' specifies the number of seconds to
schedule between regular typing breaks.  This variable doesn't directly
affect the time schedule; it simply provides a default for the
`type-break-schedule' command.

If set, the variable `type-break-good-rest-interval' specifies the minimum
amount of time which is considered a reasonable typing break.  Whenever
that time has elapsed, typing breaks are automatically rescheduled for
later even if emacs didn't prompt you to take one first.  Also, if a break
is ended before this much time has elapsed, the user will be asked whether
or not to continue.

The variable `type-break-keystroke-threshold' is used to determine the
thresholds at which typing breaks should be considered.  You can use
the command `type-break-guesstimate-keystroke-threshold' to try to
approximate good values for this.

There are several variables that affect how or when warning messages about
imminent typing breaks are displayed.  They include:

        `type-break-mode-line-message-mode'
        `type-break-time-warning-intervals'
        `type-break-keystroke-warning-intervals'
        `type-break-warning-repeat'
        `type-break-warning-countdown-string'
        `type-break-warning-countdown-string-type'

There are several variables that affect if, how, and when queries to begin
a typing break occur.  They include:

        `type-break-query-mode'
        `type-break-query-function'
        `type-break-query-interval'

Finally, the command `type-break-statistics' prints interesting things.Ftype-break
Take a typing break.

During the break, a demo selected from the functions listed in
`type-break-demo-functions' is run.

After the typing break is finished, the next break is scheduled
as per the function `type-break-schedule'.Ftype-break-statistics
Print statistics about typing breaks in a temporary buffer.
This includes the last time a typing break was taken, when the next one is
scheduled, the keystroke thresholds and the current keystroke count, etc.Ftype-break-guesstimate-keystroke-threshold
Guess values for the minimum/maximum keystroke threshold for typing breaks.

If called interactively, the user is prompted for their guess as to how
many words per minute they usually type.  This value should not be your
maximum WPM, but your average.  Of course, this is harder to gauge since it
can vary considerably depending on what you are doing.  For example, one
tends to type less when debugging a program as opposed to writing
documentation.  (Perhaps a separate program should be written to estimate
average typing speed.)

From that, this command sets the values in `type-break-keystroke-threshold'
based on a fairly simple algorithm involving assumptions about the average
length of words (5).  For the minimum threshold, it uses about a fifth of
the computed maximum threshold.

When called from lisp programs, the optional args WORDLEN and FRAC can be
used to override the default assumption about average word length and the
fraction of the maximum threshold to which to set the minimum threshold.
FRAC should be the inverse of the fractional value; for example, a value of
2 would mean to use one half, a value of 4 would mean to use one quarter, etc.Funderline-region
Underline all nonblank characters in the region.
Works by overstriking underscores.
Called from program, takes two arguments START and END
which specify the range to operate on.Fununderline-region
Remove all underlining (overstruck underscores) in the region.
Called from program, takes two arguments START and END
which specify the range to operate on.Fundigestify-rmail-message
Break up a digest message into its constituent messages.
Leaves original message, deleted, before the undigestified messages.Funforward-rmail-message
Extract a forwarded message from the containing message.
This puts the forwarded message into a separate rmail message
following the containing message.Fbatch-unrmail
Convert Rmail files to system inbox format.
Specify the input Rmail file names as command line arguments.
For each Rmail file, the corresponding output file name
is made by adding `.mail' at the end.
For example, invoke `emacs -batch -f batch-unrmail RMAIL'.Funrmail
Convert Rmail file FILE to system inbox format file TO-FILE.Fask-user-about-lock
Ask user what to do when he wants to edit FILE but it is locked by OPPONENT.
This function has a choice of three things to do:
  do (signal 'file-locked (list FILE OPPONENT))
    to refrain from editing the file
  return t (grab the lock on the file)
  return nil (edit the file even though it is locked).
You can redefine this function to choose among those three alternatives
in any way you like.Fask-user-about-supersession-threat
Ask a user who is about to modify an obsolete buffer what to do.
This function has two choices: it can return, in which case the modification
of the buffer will proceed, or it can (signal 'file-supersession (file)),
in which case the proposed buffer modification will not be made.

You can rewrite this to use any criterion you like to choose which one to do.
The buffer in question is current when this function is called.Fuudecode-decode-region-external
Uudecode region between START and END using external program.
If FILE-NAME is non-nil, save the result to FILE-NAME.  The program
used is specified by `uudecode-decoder-program'.Fuudecode-decode-region
Uudecode region between START and END without using an external program.
If FILE-NAME is non-nil, save the result to FILE-NAME.Vvc-checkout-hook
*Normal hook (list of functions) run after checking out a file.
See `run-hooks'.Vvc-checkin-hook
*Normal hook (list of functions) run after a checkin is done.
See `run-hooks'.Vvc-before-checkin-hook
*Normal hook (list of functions) run before a file is checked in.
See `run-hooks'.Fwith-vc-file
Check out a writable copy of FILE if necessary, then execute BODY.
Check in FILE with COMMENT (a string) after BODY has been executed.
FILE is passed through `expand-file-name'; BODY executed within
`save-excursion'.  If FILE is not under version control, or locked by
somebody else, signal error.Fedit-vc-file
Edit FILE under version control, executing body.
Checkin with COMMENT after executing BODY.
This macro uses `with-vc-file', passing args to it.
However, before executing BODY, find FILE, and after BODY, save buffer.Fvc-do-command
Execute a VC command, notifying user and checking for errors.
Output from COMMAND goes to BUFFER, or *vc* if BUFFER is nil or the
current buffer if BUFFER is t.  If the destination buffer is not
already current, set it up properly and erase it.  The command is
considered successful if its exit status does not exceed OKSTATUS (if
OKSTATUS is nil, that means to ignore errors, if it is 'async, that
means not to wait for termination of the subprocess).  FILE is the
name of the working file (may also be nil, to execute commands that
don't expect a file name).  If an optional list of FLAGS is present,
that is inserted into the command line before the filename.Fvc-next-action
Do the next logical version control operation on the current file.

If you call this from within a VC dired buffer with no files marked,
it will operate on the file in the current line.

If you call this from within a VC dired buffer, and one or more
files are marked, it will accept a log message and then operate on
each one.  The log message will be used as a comment for any register
or checkin operations, but ignored when doing checkouts.  Attempted
lock steals will raise an error.

A prefix argument lets you specify the version number to use.

For RCS and SCCS files:
   If the file is not already registered, this registers it for version
control.
   If the file is registered and not locked by anyone, this checks out
a writable and locked file ready for editing.
   If the file is checked out and locked by the calling user, this
first checks to see if the file has changed since checkout.  If not,
it performs a revert.
   If the file has been changed, this pops up a buffer for entry
of a log message; when the message has been entered, it checks in the
resulting changes along with the log message as change commentary.  If
the variable `vc-keep-workfiles' is non-nil (which is its default), a
read-only copy of the changed file is left in place afterwards.
   If the file is registered and locked by someone else, you are given
the option to steal the lock.

For CVS files:
   If the file is not already registered, this registers it for version
control.  This does a "cvs add", but no "cvs commit".
   If the file is added but not committed, it is committed.
   If your working file is changed, but the repository file is
unchanged, this pops up a buffer for entry of a log message; when the
message has been entered, it checks in the resulting changes along
with the logmessage as change commentary.  A writable file is retained.
   If the repository file is changed, you are asked if you want to
merge in the changes into your working copy.Fvc-register
Register the current file into a version control system.
With prefix argument SET-VERSION, allow user to specify initial version
level.  If COMMENT is present, use that as an initial comment.

The version control system to use is found by cycling through the list
`vc-handled-backends'.  The first backend in that list which declares
itself responsible for the file (usually because other files in that
directory are already registered under that backend) will be used to
register the file.  If no backend declares itself responsible, the
first backend that could register the file is used.Fvc-diff
Display diffs between file versions.
Normally this compares the current file and buffer with the most
recent checked in version of that file.  This uses no arguments.  With
a prefix argument HISTORIC, it reads the file name to use and two
version designators specifying which versions to compare.  The
optional argument NOT-URGENT non-nil means it is ok to say no to
saving the buffer.Fvc-version-other-window
Visit version REV of the current file in another window.
If the current file is named `F', the version is named `F.~REV~'.
If `F.~REV~' already exists, use it instead of checking it out again.Fvc-insert-headers
Insert headers into a file for use with a version control system.
Headers desired are inserted at point, and are pulled from
the variable `vc-BACKEND-header'.Fvc-merge
Merge changes between two versions into the current buffer's file.
This asks for two versions to merge from in the minibuffer.  If the
first version is a branch number, then merge all changes from that
branch.  If the first version is empty, merge news, i.e. recent changes
from the current branch.

See Info node `Merging'.Fvc-resolve-conflicts
Invoke ediff to resolve conflicts in the current buffer.
The conflicts must be marked with rcsmerge conflict markers.Fvc-directory
Create a buffer in VC Dired Mode for directory DIR.

See Info node `VC Dired Mode'.

With prefix arg READ-SWITCHES, specify a value to override
`dired-listing-switches' when generating the listing.Fvc-create-snapshot
Descending recursively from DIR, make a snapshot called NAME.
For each registered file, the version level of its latest version
becomes part of the named configuration.  If the prefix argument
BRANCHP is given, the snapshot is made as a new branch and the files
are checked out in that new branch.Fvc-retrieve-snapshot
Descending recursively from DIR, retrieve the snapshot called NAME.
If NAME is empty, it refers to the latest versions.
If locking is used for the files in DIR, then there must not be any
locked files at or below DIR (but if NAME is empty, locked files are
allowed and simply skipped).Fvc-print-log
List the change log of the current buffer in a window.Fvc-revert-buffer
Revert the current buffer's file to the version it was based on.
This asks for confirmation if the buffer contents are not identical
to that version.  This function does not automatically pick up newer
changes found in the master file; use \[universal-argument] \[vc-next-action] to do so.Fvc-cancel-version
Get rid of most recently checked in version of this file.
A prefix argument NOREVERT means do not revert the buffer afterwards.Fvc-switch-backend
Make BACKEND the current version control system for FILE.
FILE must already be registered in BACKEND.  The change is not
permanent, only for the current session.  This function only changes
VC's perspective on FILE, it does not register or unregister it.
By default, this command cycles through the registered backends.
To get a prompt, use a prefix argument.Fvc-transfer-file
Transfer FILE to another version control system NEW-BACKEND.
If NEW-BACKEND has a higher precedence than FILE's current backend
(i.e.  it comes earlier in `vc-handled-backends'), then register FILE in
NEW-BACKEND, using the version number from the current backend as the
base level.  If NEW-BACKEND has a lower precedence than the current
backend, then commit all changes that were made under the current
backend to NEW-BACKEND, and unregister FILE from the current backend.
(If FILE is not yet registered under NEW-BACKEND, register it.)Fvc-rename-file
Rename file OLD to NEW, and rename its master file likewise.Fvc-update-change-log
Find change log file and add entries from recent version control logs.
Normally, find log entries for all registered files in the default
directory.

With prefix arg of \[universal-argument], only find log entries for the current buffer's file.

With any numeric prefix arg, find log entries for all currently visited
files that are under version control.  This puts all the entries in the
log for the default directory, which may not be appropriate.

From a program, any ARGS are assumed to be filenames for which
log entries should be gathered.Fvc-annotate
Display the edit history of the current file using colours.

This command creates a buffer that shows, for each line of the current
file, when it was last edited and by whom.  Additionally, colours are
used to show the age of each line--blue means oldest, red means
youngest, and intermediate colours indicate intermediate ages.  By
default, the time scale stretches back one year into the past;
everything that is older than that is shown in blue.

With a prefix argument, this command asks two questions in the
minibuffer.  First, you may enter a version number; then the buffer
displays and annotates that version instead of the current version
(type RET in the minibuffer to leave that default unchanged).  Then,
you are prompted for a stretch factor for the time scale.  This makes
the color range cover a time span longer or shorter than the default
of one year.  For example, a factor of 0.1 means that the range from
red to blue stands for the past 36 days only, and everything that is
older than that is shown in blue.

Customization variables:

`vc-annotate-menu-elements' customizes the menu elements of the
mode-specific menu. `vc-annotate-color-map' and
`vc-annotate-very-old-color' defines the mapping of time to
colors. `vc-annotate-background' specifies the background color.Vvc-rcs-master-templates
*Where to look for RCS master files.
For a description of possible values, see `vc-check-master-templates'.Vvc-sccs-master-templates
*Where to look for SCCS master files.
For a description of possible values, see `vc-check-master-templates'.Fvc-sccs-search-project-dir
Return the name of a master file in the SCCS project directory.
Does not check whether the file exists but returns nil if it does not
find any project directory.Fvhdl-mode
Major mode for editing VHDL code.

Usage:
------

- TEMPLATE INSERTION (electrification):  After typing a VHDL keyword and
  entering `\[vhdl-electric-space]', you are prompted for arguments while a template is generated
  for that VHDL construct.  Typing `\[vhdl-electric-return]' or `\[keyboard-quit]' at the first (mandatory)
  prompt aborts the current template generation.  Optional arguments are
  indicated by square brackets and removed if the queried string is left empty.
  Prompts for mandatory arguments remain in the code if the queried string is
  left empty.  They can be queried again by `\[vhdl-template-search-prompt]'.
  Typing `\[just-one-space]' after a keyword inserts a space without calling the template
  generator.  Automatic template generation (i.e. electrification) can be
  disabled (enabled) by typing `\[vhdl-electric-mode]' or by setting custom variable
  `vhdl-electric-mode' (see CUSTOMIZATION).
  Enabled electrification is indicated by `/e' in the modeline.
  Template generators can be invoked from the VHDL menu, by key bindings, by
  typing `C-c C-i C-c' and choosing a construct, or by typing the keyword (i.e.
  first word of menu entry not in parenthesis) and `\[vhdl-electric-space]'.
  The following abbreviations can also be used:
  arch, attr, cond, conf, comp, cons, func, inst, pack, sig, var.
  Template styles can be customized in customization group `vhdl-electric'
  (see CUSTOMIZATION).

- HEADER INSERTION:  A file header can be inserted by `\[vhdl-template-header]'.  A
  file footer (template at the end of the file) can be inserted by
  `\[vhdl-template-footer]'.  See customization group `vhdl-header'.

- STUTTERING:  Double striking of some keys inserts cumbersome VHDL syntax
  elements.  Stuttering can be disabled (enabled) by typing `\[vhdl-stutter-mode]' or by
  variable `vhdl-stutter-mode'.  Enabled stuttering is indicated by `/s' in
  the modeline.  The stuttering keys and their effects are:
      ;;   -->  " : "         [   -->  (        --    -->  comment
      ;;;  -->  " := "        [[  -->  [        --CR  -->  comment-out code
      ..   -->  " => "        ]   -->  )        ---   -->  horizontal line
      ,,   -->  " <= "        ]]  -->  ]        ----  -->  display comment
      ==   -->  " == "        ''  -->  \"

- WORD COMPLETION:  Typing `\[vhdl-electric-tab]' after a (not completed) word looks for a VHDL
  keyword or a word in the buffer that starts alike, inserts it and adjusts
  case.  Re-typing `\[vhdl-electric-tab]' toggles through alternative word completions.
  This also works in the minibuffer (i.e. in template generator prompts).
  Typing `\[vhdl-electric-tab]' after `(' looks for and inserts complete parenthesized
  expressions (e.g. for array index ranges).  All keywords as well as standard
  types and subprograms of VHDL have predefined abbreviations (e.g. type "std"
  and `\[vhdl-electric-tab]' will toggle through all standard types beginning with "std").

  Typing `\[vhdl-electric-tab]' after a non-word character indents the line if at the beginning
  of a line (i.e. no preceding non-blank characters),and inserts a tabulator
  stop otherwise.  `\[tab-to-tab-stop]' always inserts a tabulator stop.

- COMMENTS:
      `--'       puts a single comment.
      `---'      draws a horizontal line for separating code segments.
      `----'     inserts a display comment, i.e. two horizontal lines with a
                 comment in between.
      `--CR'     comments out code on that line.  Re-hitting CR comments out
                 following lines.
      `\[vhdl-comment-uncomment-region]'  comments out a region if not commented out,
                 uncomments a region if already commented out.

  You are prompted for comments after object definitions (i.e. signals,
  variables, constants, ports) and after subprogram and process specifications
  if variable `vhdl-prompt-for-comments' is non-nil.  Comments are
  automatically inserted as additional labels (e.g. after begin statements) and
  as help comments if `vhdl-self-insert-comments' is non-nil.
  Inline comments (i.e. comments after a piece of code on the same line) are
  indented at least to `vhdl-inline-comment-column'.  Comments go at maximum to
  `vhdl-end-comment-column'.  `\[vhdl-electric-return]' after a space in a comment will open a
  new comment line.  Typing beyond `vhdl-end-comment-column' in a comment
  automatically opens a new comment line.  `\[fill-paragraph]' re-fills
  multi-line comments.

- INDENTATION:  `\[vhdl-electric-tab]' indents a line if at the beginning of the line.
  The amount of indentation is specified by variable `vhdl-basic-offset'.
  `\[vhdl-indent-line]' always indents the current line (is bound to `TAB' if variable
  `vhdl-intelligent-tab' is nil).  Indentation can be done for an entire region
  (`\[vhdl-indent-region]') or buffer (menu).  Argument and port lists are indented normally
  (nil) or relative to the opening parenthesis (non-nil) according to variable
  `vhdl-argument-list-indent'.  If variable `vhdl-indent-tabs-mode' is nil,
  spaces are used instead of tabs.  `\[tabify]' and `\[untabify]' allow
  to convert spaces to tabs and vice versa.

- ALIGNMENT:  The alignment functions align operators, keywords, and inline
  comment to beautify argument lists, port maps, etc.  `\[vhdl-align-group]' aligns a group
  of consecutive lines separated by blank lines.  `\[vhdl-align-noindent-region]' aligns an
  entire region.  If variable `vhdl-align-groups' is non-nil, groups of code
  lines separated by empty lines are aligned individually.  `\[vhdl-align-inline-comment-group]' aligns
  inline comments for a group of lines, and `\[vhdl-align-inline-comment-region]' for a region.
  Some templates are automatically aligned after generation if custom variable
  `vhdl-auto-align' is non-nil.
  `\[vhdl-fixup-whitespace-region]' fixes up whitespace in a region.  That is, operator symbols
  are surrounded by one space, and multiple spaces are eliminated.

- PORT TRANSLATION:  Generic and port clauses from entity or component
  declarations can be copied (`\[vhdl-port-copy]') and pasted as entity and
  component declarations, as component instantiations and corresponding
  internal constants and signals, as a generic map with constants as actual
  parameters, and as a test bench (menu).
  A clause with several generic/port names on the same line can be flattened
  (`\[vhdl-port-flatten]') so that only one name per line exists.  Names for actual
  ports, instances, test benches, and design-under-test instances can be
  derived from existing names according to variables `vhdl-...-name'.
  Variables `vhdl-testbench-...' allow the insertion of additional templates
  into a test bench.  New files are created for the test bench entity and
  architecture according to variable `vhdl-testbench-create-files'.
  See customization group `vhdl-port'.

- TEST BENCH GENERATION:  See PORT TRANSLATION.

- KEY BINDINGS:  Key bindings (`C-c ...') exist for most commands (see in
  menu).

- VHDL MENU:  All commands can be invoked from the VHDL menu.

- FILE BROWSER:  The speedbar allows browsing of directories and file contents.
  It can be accessed from the VHDL menu and is automatically opened if
  variable `vhdl-speedbar' is non-nil.
  In speedbar, open files and directories with `mouse-2' on the name and
  browse/rescan their contents with `mouse-2'/`S-mouse-2' on the `+'.

- DESIGN HIERARCHY BROWSER:  The speedbar can also be used for browsing the
  hierarchy of design units contained in the source files of the current
  directory or in the source files/directories specified for a project (see
  variable `vhdl-project-alist').
  The speedbar can be switched between file and hierarchy browsing mode in the
  VHDL menu or by typing `f' and `h' in speedbar.
  In speedbar, open design units with `mouse-2' on the name and browse their
  hierarchy with `mouse-2' on the `+'.  The hierarchy can be rescanned and
  ports directly be copied from entities by using the speedbar menu.

- PROJECTS:  Projects can be defined in variable `vhdl-project-alist' and a
  current project be selected using variable `vhdl-project' (permanently) or
  from the menu (temporarily).  For each project, a title string (for the file
  headers) and source files/directories (for the hierarchy browser) can be
  specified.

- SPECIAL MENUES:  As an alternative to the speedbar, an index menu can
  be added (set variable `vhdl-index-menu' to non-nil) or made accessible
  as a mouse menu (e.g. add "(global-set-key '[S-down-mouse-3] 'imenu)" to
  your start-up file) for browsing the file contents.  Also, a source file menu
  can be added (set variable `vhdl-source-file-menu' to non-nil) for browsing
  the current directory for VHDL source files.

- SOURCE FILE COMPILATION:  The syntax of the current buffer can be analyzed
  by calling a VHDL compiler (menu, `\[vhdl-compile]').  The compiler to be used is
  specified by variable `vhdl-compiler'.  The available compilers are listed
  in variable `vhdl-compiler-alist' including all required compilation command,
  destination directory, and error message syntax information.  New compilers
  can be added.  Additional compile command options can be set in variable
  `vhdl-compiler-options'.
  An entire hierarchy of source files can be compiled by the `make' command
  (menu, `\[vhdl-make]').  This only works if an appropriate Makefile exists.
  The make command itself as well as a command to generate a Makefile can also
  be specified in variable `vhdl-compiler-alist'.

- VHDL STANDARDS:  The VHDL standards to be used are specified in variable
  `vhdl-standard'.  Available standards are: VHDL'87/'93, VHDL-AMS,
  Math Packages.

- KEYWORD CASE:  Lower and upper case for keywords and standardized types,
  attributes, and enumeration values is supported.  If the variable
  `vhdl-upper-case-keywords' is set to non-nil, keywords can be typed in lower
  case and are converted into upper case automatically (not for types,
  attributes, and enumeration values).  The case of keywords, types,
  attributes,and enumeration values can be fixed for an entire region (menu)
  or buffer (`\[vhdl-fix-case-buffer]') according to the variables
  `vhdl-upper-case-{keywords,types,attributes,enum-values}'.

- HIGHLIGHTING (fontification):  Keywords and standardized types, attributes,
  enumeration values, and function names (controlled by variable
  `vhdl-highlight-keywords'), as well as comments, strings, and template
  prompts are highlighted using different colors.  Unit, subprogram, signal,
  variable, constant, parameter and generic/port names in declarations as well
  as labels are highlighted if variable `vhdl-highlight-names' is non-nil.

  Additional reserved words or words with a forbidden syntax (e.g. words that
  should be avoided) can be specified in variable `vhdl-forbidden-words' or
  `vhdl-forbidden-syntax' and be highlighted in a warning color (variable
  `vhdl-highlight-forbidden-words').  Verilog keywords are highlighted as
  forbidden words if variable `vhdl-highlight-verilog-keywords' is non-nil.

  Words with special syntax can be highlighted by specifying their syntax and
  color in variable `vhdl-special-syntax-alist' and by setting variable
  `vhdl-highlight-special-words' to non-nil.  This allows to establish some
  naming conventions (e.g. to distinguish different kinds of signals or other
  objects by using name suffices) and to support them visually.

  Variable `vhdl-highlight-case-sensitive' can be set to non-nil in order to
  support case-sensitive highlighting.  However, keywords are then only
  highlighted if written in lower case.

  Code between "translate_off" and "translate_on" pragmas is highlighted
  using a different background color if variable `vhdl-highlight-translate-off'
  is non-nil.

  All colors can be customized by command `\[customize-face]'.
  For highlighting of matching parenthesis, see customization group
  `paren-showing' (`\[customize-group]').

- USER MODELS:  VHDL models (templates) can be specified by the user and made
  accessible in the menu, through key bindings (`C-c C-m ...'), or by keyword
  electrification.  See custom variable `vhdl-model-alist'.

- HIDE/SHOW:  The code of entire VHDL design units can be hidden using the
  `Hide/Show' menu or by pressing `S-mouse-2' within the code (variable
  `vhdl-hideshow-menu').

- PRINTING:  Postscript printing with different faces (an optimized set of
  faces is used if `vhdl-print-customize-faces' is non-nil) or colors
  (if `ps-print-color-p' is non-nil) is possible using the standard Emacs
  postscript printing commands.  Variable `vhdl-print-two-column' defines
  appropriate default settings for nice landscape two-column printing.  The
  paper format can be set by variable `ps-paper-type'.  Do not forget to
  switch `ps-print-color-p' to nil for printing on black-and-white printers.

- CUSTOMIZATION:  All variables can easily be customized using the `Customize'
  menu entry or `\[customize-option]' (`\[customize-group]' for groups).
  Some customizations only take effect after some action (read the NOTE in
  the variable documentation).  Customization can also be done globally (i.e.
  site-wide, read the INSTALL file).

- FILE EXTENSIONS:  As default, files with extensions ".vhd" and ".vhdl" are
  automatically recognized as VHDL source files.  To add an extension ".xxx",
  add the following line to your Emacs start-up file (`.emacs'):
    (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.xxx\\'" . vhdl-mode) auto-mode-alist))

- HINTS:
  - Type `\[keyboard-quit] \[keyboard-quit]' to interrupt long operations or if Emacs hangs.

\{vhdl-mode-map}Fvi-mode
Major mode that acts like the `vi' editor.
The purpose of this mode is to provide you the combined power of vi (namely,
the "cross product" effect of commands and repeat last changes) and Emacs.

This command redefines nearly all keys to look like vi commands.
It records the previous major mode, and any vi command for input
(`i', `a', `s', etc.) switches back to that mode.
Thus, ordinary Emacs (in whatever major mode you had been using)
is "input" mode as far as vi is concerned.

To get back into vi from "input" mode, you must issue this command again.
Therefore, it is recommended that you assign it to a key.

Major differences between this mode and real vi :

* Limitations and unsupported features
  - Search patterns with line offset (e.g. /pat/+3 or /pat/z.) are
    not supported.
  - Ex commands are not implemented; try ':' to get some hints.
  - No line undo (i.e. the 'U' command), but multi-undo is a standard feature.

* Modifications
  - The stopping positions for some point motion commands (word boundary,
    pattern search) are slightly different from standard 'vi'.
    Also, no automatic wrap around at end of buffer for pattern searching.
  - Since changes are done in two steps (deletion then insertion), you need
    to undo twice to completely undo a change command.  But this is not needed
    for undoing a repeated change command.
  - No need to set/unset 'magic', to search for a string with regular expr
    in it just put a prefix arg for the search commands.  Replace cmds too.
  - ^R is bound to incremental backward search, so use ^L to redraw screen.

* Extensions
  - Some standard (or modified) Emacs commands were integrated, such as
    incremental search, query replace, transpose objects, and keyboard macros.
  - In command state, ^X links to the 'ctl-x-map', and ESC can be linked to
    esc-map or set undefined.  These can give you the full power of Emacs.
  - See vi-com-map for those keys that are extensions to standard vi, e.g.
    `vi-name-last-change-or-macro', `vi-verify-spelling', `vi-locate-def',
    `vi-mark-region', and 'vi-quote-words'.  Some of them are quite handy.
  - Use \[vi-switch-mode] to switch among different modes quickly.

(among them most letters and punctuation) beep and tell that the buffer is
read-only.
\<view-mode-map>
The following additional commands are provided.  Most commands take prefix
arguments.  Page commands default to "page size" lines which is almost a whole
window full, or number of lines set by \[View-scroll-page-forward-set-page-size] or \[View-scroll-page-backward-set-page-size].  Half page commands default to
and set "half page size" lines which initially is half a window full.  Search
commands default to a repeat count of one.

H, h, ?	 This message.
Digits	provide prefix arguments.
\[negative-argument]	negative prefix argument.
\[beginning-of-buffer]	move to the beginning of buffer.
>	move to the end of buffer.
\[View-scroll-to-buffer-end]	scroll so that buffer end is at last line of window.
SPC	scroll forward "page size" lines.

DEL	scroll backward "page size" lines.
	  With prefix scroll backward prefix lines.
\[View-scroll-page-forward-set-page-size]	like  \[View-scroll-page-forward]  but with prefix sets "page size" to prefix.
\[View-scroll-page-backward-set-page-size]	like  \[View-scroll-page-backward]  but with prefix sets "page size" to prefix.
\[View-scroll-half-page-forward]	scroll forward "half page size" lines.  With prefix, sets
	  "half page size" to prefix lines and scrolls forward that much.
\[View-scroll-half-page-backward]	scroll backward "half page size" lines.  With prefix, sets
	  "half page size" to prefix lines and scrolls backward that much.
RET, LFD  scroll forward one line.  With prefix scroll forward prefix line(s).
y	scroll backward one line.  With prefix scroll backward prefix line(s).
\[View-revert-buffer-scroll-page-forward]	revert-buffer if necessary and scroll forward.
	  Use this to view a changing file.
\[what-line]	prints the current line number.
\[View-goto-percent]	goes prefix argument (default 100) percent into buffer.
\[View-goto-line]	goes to line given by prefix argument (default first line).
.	set the mark.
x	exchanges point and mark.
\[View-back-to-mark]	return to mark and pops mark ring.
	  Mark ring is pushed at start of every successful search and when
	  jump to line occurs.  The mark is set on jump to buffer start or end.
\[point-to-register]	save current position in character register.
'	go to position saved in character register.
s	do forward incremental search.
r	do reverse incremental search.
\[View-search-regexp-forward]	searches forward for regular expression, starting after current page.
	  ! and @ have a special meaning at the beginning of the regexp.
	  ! means search for a line with no match for regexp.  @ means start
	  search at beginning (end for backward search) of buffer.
\	searches backward for regular expression, starting before current page.
\[View-search-last-regexp-forward]	searches forward for last regular expression.
p	searches backward for last regular expression.
\[View-quit]	quit View mode, trying to restore window and buffer to previous state.
	  \[View-quit] is the normal way to leave view mode.
\[View-exit]	exit View mode but stay in current buffer.  Use this if you started
	  viewing a buffer (file) and find out you want to edit it.
\[View-exit-and-edit]	exit View mode and make the current buffer editable.
\[View-quit-all]	quit View mode, trying to restore windows and buffer to previous state.
\[View-leave]	quit View mode and maybe switch buffers, but don't kill this buffer.
\[View-kill-and-leave]	quit View mode, kill current buffer and go back to other buffer.

The effect of \[View-leave] , \[View-quit] and \[View-kill-and-leave] depends on how view-mode was entered.  If it was
entered by view-file, view-file-other-window or view-file-other-frame
(\[view-file], \[view-file-other-window], \[view-file-other-frame] or the dired mode v command), then \[View-quit] will
try to kill the current buffer.  If view-mode was entered from another buffer
as is done by View-buffer, View-buffer-other-window, View-buffer-other frame,
View-file, View-file-other-window or View-file-other-frame then \[View-leave] , \[View-quit] and \[View-kill-and-leave]
will return to that buffer.

Entry to view-mode runs the normal hook `view-mode-hook'.Fview-mode-enter
Enter View mode and set up exit from view mode depending on optional arguments.
If RETURN-TO is non-nil it is added as an element to the buffer local alist
`view-return-to-alist'.
Save EXIT-ACTION in buffer local variable `view-exit-action'.
It should be either nil or a function that takes a buffer as argument.
This function will be called by `view-mode-exit'.

RETURN-TO is either nil, meaning do nothing when exiting view mode, or
it has the format (WINDOW OLD-WINDOW . OLD-BUF-INFO).
WINDOW is a window used for viewing.
OLD-WINDOW is nil or the window to select after viewing.
OLD-BUF-INFO tells what to do with WINDOW when exiting.  It is one of:
1) nil       Do nothing.
2) t         Delete WINDOW or, if it is the only window, its frame.
3) (OLD-BUFF START POINT)  Display buffer OLD-BUFF with displayed text
                           starting at START and point at POINT in WINDOW.
4) quit-window   Do `quit-window' in WINDOW.

For list of all View commands, type H or h while viewing.

This function runs the normal hook `view-mode-hook'.FView-exit-and-edit

Toggle Viper on/off.
If Viper is enabled, turn it off.  Otherwise, turn it on.Fviper-mode
Turn on Viper emulation of Vi.Fwebjump
Jumps to a Web site from a programmable hotlist.

See the documentation for the `webjump-sites' variable for how to customize the
hotlist.

Please submit bug reports and other feedback to the author, Neil W. Van Dyke
<nwv@acm.org>.Vwhich-function-mode
Non-nil if Which-Function mode is enabled.
See the command `which-function-mode' for a description of this minor-mode.
Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `which-function-mode'.Fwhich-function-mode
Toggle Which Function mode, globally.
When Which Function mode is enabled, the current function name is
continuously displayed in the mode line, in certain major modes.

With prefix ARG, turn Which Function mode on iff arg is positive,
and off otherwise.Fwhitespace-toggle-leading-check
Toggle the check for leading space in the local buffer.Fwhitespace-toggle-trailing-check
Toggle the check for trailing space in the local buffer.Fwhitespace-toggle-indent-check
Toggle the check for indentation space in the local buffer.Fwhitespace-toggle-spacetab-check
Toggle the check for space-followed-by-TABs in the local buffer.Fwhitespace-toggle-ateol-check
Toggle the check for end-of-line space in the local buffer.Fwhitespace-buffer
Find five different types of white spaces in buffer.
These are:
1. Leading space (empty lines at the top of a file).
2. Trailing space (empty lines at the end of a file).
3. Indentation space (8 or more spaces, that should be replaced with TABS).
4. Spaces followed by a TAB. (Almost always, we never want that).
5. Spaces or TABS at the end of a line.

Check for whitespace only if this buffer really contains a non-empty file
and:
1. the major mode is one of the whitespace-modes, or
2. `whitespace-buffer' was explicitly called with a prefix argument.Fwhitespace-region
Check the region for whitespace errors.Fwhitespace-cleanup
Cleanup the five different kinds of whitespace problems.

Use \[describe-function] whitespace-describe to read a summary of the
whitespace problems.Fwhitespace-cleanup-region
Whitespace cleanup on the region.Vwhitespace-global-mode
Toggle global Whitespace mode.

Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either \[customize] or the function `whitespace-global-mode'
(which see).Fwhitespace-global-mode
Toggle using Whitespace mode in new buffers.
With ARG, turn the mode on if and only iff ARG is positive.

When this mode is active, `whitespace-buffer' is added to
`find-file-hooks' and `kill-buffer-hook'.Fwhitespace-write-file-hook
The local-write-file-hook to be called on the buffer when
whitespace check is enabled.Fwhitespace-describe
A summary of whitespaces and what this library can do about them.

The whitespace library is intended to find and help fix five different types
of whitespace problems that commonly exist in source code.

1. Leading space (empty lines at the top of a file).
2. Trailing space (empty lines at the end of a file).
3. Indentation space (8 or more spaces at beginning of line, that should be
		      replaced with TABS).
4. Spaces followed by a TAB.  (Almost always, we never want that).
5. Spaces or TABS at the end of a line.

Whitespace errors are reported in a buffer, and on the modeline.

Modeline will show a W:<x>!<y> to denote a particular type of whitespace,
where `x' and `y' can be one (or more) of:

e - End-of-Line whitespace.
i - Indentation whitespace.
l - Leading whitespace.
s - Space followed by Tab.
t - Trailing whitespace.

If any of the whitespace checks is turned off, the modeline will display a
!<y>.

    (since (3) is the most controversial one, here is the rationale: Most
    terminal drivers and printer drivers have TAB configured or even
    hardcoded to be 8 spaces.  (Some of them allow configuration, but almost
    always they default to 8.)

    Changing `tab-width' to other than 8 and editing will cause your code to
    look different from within Emacs, and say, if you cat it or more it, or
    even print it.

    Almost all the popular programming modes let you define an offset (like
    c-basic-offset or perl-indent-level) to configure the offset, so you
    should never have to set your `tab-width' to be other than 8 in all these
    modes.  In fact, with an indent level of say, 4, 2 TABS will cause Emacs
    to replace your 8 spaces with one 	 (try it).  If vi users in your
    office complain, tell them to use vim, which distinguishes between
    tabstop and shiftwidth (vi equivalent of our offsets), and also ask them
    to set smarttab.)

All the above have caused (and will cause) unwanted codeline integration and
merge problems.

whitespace.el will complain if it detects whitespaces on opening a file, and
warn you on closing a file also (in case you had inserted any
whitespaces during the process of your editing).Fwidget-browse-at
Browse the widget under point.Fwidget-browse
Create a widget browser for WIDGET.Fwidget-browse-other-window

"left" is relative to the position of point in the window; otherwise
it is relative to the top edge (for positive ARG) or the bottom edge
(for negative ARG) of the current window.
If no window is at the desired location, an error is signaled.Fwindmove-up
Select the window above the current one.
With no prefix argument, or with prefix argument equal to zero, "up"
is relative to the position of point in the window; otherwise it is
relative to the left edge (for positive ARG) or the right edge (for
negative ARG) of the current window.
If no window is at the desired location, an error is signaled.Fwindmove-right
Select the window to the right of the current one.

Browse UN*X man page for TOPIC (Without using external Man program).
The major browsing mode used is essentially the standard Man mode.
Choose the filename for the man page using completion, based on the
topic selected from the directories specified in `woman-manpath' and
`woman-path'.  The directory expansions and topics are cached for
speed, but a non-nil interactive argument forces the caches to be
updated (e.g. to re-interpret the current directory).

Used non-interactively, arguments are optional: if given then TOPIC
should be a topic string and non-nil RE-CACHE forces re-caching.Fwoman-dired-find-file
In dired, run the WoMan man-page browser on this file.Fwoman-find-file
Find, decode and browse a specific UN*X man-page source file FILE-NAME.
Use existing buffer if possible; reformat only if prefix arg given.
When called interactively, optional argument REFORMAT forces reformatting
of an existing WoMan buffer formatted earlier.
No external programs are used, except that `gunzip' will be used to
decompress the file if appropriate.  See the documentation for the
`woman' command for further details.Fwordstar-mode

STRING is included in the mode line iff VARIABLE's value is non-nil.

Actually, STRING need not be a string; any possible mode-line element
is okay.  See `mode-line-format'.Fcomplete-symbol
Perform tags completion on the text around point.
Completes to the set of names listed in the current tags table.
The string to complete is chosen in the same way as the default
for \[find-tag] (which see).

the collection of symbols listed in the index of the manual for the
language you are using.Vmode-specific-map
Keymap for characters following C-c.Fmap-y-or-n-p
Ask a series of boolean questions.
Takes args PROMPTER ACTOR LIST, and optional args HELP and ACTION-ALIST.

LIST is a list of objects, or a function of no arguments to return the next
object or nil.

If PROMPTER is a string, the prompt is (format PROMPTER OBJECT).  If not
a string, PROMPTER is a function of one arg (an object from LIST), which
returns a string to be used as the prompt for that object.  If the return
value is not a string, it may be nil to ignore the object or non-nil to act
on the object without asking the user.

ACTOR is a function of one arg (an object from LIST),
which gets called with each object that the user answers `yes' for.

If HELP is given, it is a list (OBJECT OBJECTS ACTION),
where OBJECT is a string giving the singular noun for an elt of LIST;
OBJECTS is the plural noun for elts of LIST, and ACTION is a transitive
verb describing ACTOR.  The default is ("object" "objects" "act on").

At the prompts, the user may enter y, Y, or SPC to act on that object;
n, N, or DEL to skip that object; ! to act on all following objects;
ESC or q to exit (skip all following objects); . (period) to act on the
current object and then exit; or \[help-command] to get help.

If ACTION-ALIST is given, it is an alist (KEY FUNCTION HELP) of extra keys
that will be accepted.  KEY is a character; FUNCTION is a function of one
arg (an object from LIST); HELP is a string.  When the user hits KEY,
FUNCTION is called.  If it returns non-nil, the object is considered
"acted upon", and the next object from LIST is processed.  If it returns
nil, the prompt is repeated for the same object.

Final optional argument NO-CURSOR-IN-ECHO-AREA non-nil says not to set
`cursor-in-echo-area' while prompting.

This function uses `query-replace-map' to define the standard responses,
but not all of the responses which `query-replace' understands
are meaningful here.

Returns the number of actions taken.Fread-envvar-name
Read environment variable name, prompting with PROMPT.
Optional second arg MUSTMATCH, if non-nil, means require existing envvar name.
If it is also not t, RET does not exit if it does non-null completion.Fsetenv
Set the value of the environment variable named VARIABLE to VALUE.
VARIABLE should be a string.  VALUE is optional; if not provided or is
`nil', the environment variable VARIABLE will be removed.  

Interactively, a prefix argument means to unset the variable.
Interactively, the current value (if any) of the variable
appears at the front of the history list when you type in the new value.

This function works by modifying `process-environment'.Fgetenv
Get the value of environment variable VARIABLE.
VARIABLE should be a string.  Value is nil if VARIABLE is undefined in
the environment.  Otherwise, value is a string.

This function consults the variable `process-environment'
for its value.Vmule-version
Version number and name of this version of MULE (multilingual environment).Vmule-version-date
Distribution date of this version of MULE (multilingual environment).Fload-with-code-conversion

 optional third arg NOMESSAGE is non-nil.
Return t if file exists.Fcharset-quoted-standard-p
Return t if OBJ is a quoted symbol, and is the name of a standard charset.Fcharsetp
T if OBJECT is a charset.Fcharset-info
Return a vector of information of CHARSET.
The elements of the vector are:
	CHARSET-ID, BYTES, DIMENSION, CHARS, WIDTH, DIRECTION,
	LEADING-CODE-BASE, LEADING-CODE-EXT,
	ISO-FINAL-CHAR, ISO-GRAPHIC-PLANE,
	REVERSE-CHARSET, SHORT-NAME, LONG-NAME,	DESCRIPTION,
	PLIST,
where
CHARSET-ID (integer) is the identification number of the charset.
BYTES (integer) is the length of multi-byte form of a character in
  the charset: one of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
DIMENSION (integer) is the number of bytes to represent a character of
the charset: 1 or 2.

Return a character of CHARSET whose position codes are CODE1 and CODE2.
CODE1 and CODE2 are optional, but if you don't supply
sufficient position codes, return a generic character which stands for
all characters or group of characters in the character set.
A generic character can be used to index a char table (e.g. syntax-table).

Such character sets as ascii, eight-bit-control, and eight-bit-graphic
don't have corresponding generic characters.  If CHARSET is one of
them and you don't supply CODE1, return the character of the smallest
code in CHARSET.

If CODE1 or CODE2 are invalid (out of range), this function signals an error.Fcharset-list

Optional argument RESTRICTION specifies a way to map the pair of CCS
and CODE-POINT to a character.   Currently not supported and just ignored.Fencode-char
Return code-point in coded character set CCS that corresponds to CHAR.
Return nil if CHAR is not included in CCS.
Currently the only supported coded character set is `ucs' (ISO/IEC

A base coding system is what made by `make-coding-system'.
Any alias nor subsidiary coding systems are not base coding system.Fcoding-system-eol-type
Return eol-type of CODING-SYSTEM.
An eol-type is integer 0, 1, 2, or a vector of coding systems.

Integer values 0, 1, and 2 indicate a format of end-of-line; LF,
CRLF, and CR respectively.

A vector value indicates that a format of end-of-line should be
detected automatically.  Nth element of the vector is the subsidiary
coding system whose eol-type is N.Fadd-to-coding-system-list
Add CODING-SYSTEM to `coding-system-list' while keeping it sorted.Fcoding-system-list
Return a list of all existing non-subsidiary coding systems.

Define a new coding system CODING-SYSTEM (symbol).
Remaining arguments are TYPE, MNEMONIC, DOC-STRING, FLAGS (optional),
and PROPERTIES (optional) which construct a coding-spec of CODING-SYSTEM
in the following format:
	[TYPE MNEMONIC DOC-STRING PLIST FLAGS]

TYPE is an integer value indicating the type of the coding system as follows:
  0: Emacs internal format,
  1: Shift-JIS (or MS-Kanji) used mainly on Japanese PC,
  2: ISO-2022 including many variants,
  3: Big5 used mainly on Chinese PC,
  4: private, CCL programs provide encoding/decoding algorithm,
  5: Raw-text, which means that text contains random 8-bit codes.

MNEMONIC is a character to be displayed on mode line for the coding system.

DOC-STRING is a documentation string for the coding system.

FLAGS specifies more detailed information of the coding system as follows:

  If TYPE is 2 (ISO-2022), FLAGS is a list of these elements:
      CHARSET0, CHARSET1, CHARSET2, CHARSET3, SHORT-FORM,
      ASCII-EOL, ASCII-CNTL, SEVEN, LOCKING-SHIFT, SINGLE-SHIFT,
      USE-ROMAN, USE-OLDJIS, NO-ISO6429, INIT-BOL, DESIGNATION-BOL,
      SAFE, ACCEPT-LATIN-EXTRA-CODE.
    CHARSETn are character sets initially designated to Gn graphic registers.
      If CHARSETn is nil, Gn is never used.
      If CHARSETn is t, Gn can be used but nothing designated initially.
      If CHARSETn is a list of character sets, those character sets are
        designated to Gn on output, but nothing designated to Gn initially.
        But, character set `ascii' can be designated only to G0.
    SHORT-FORM non-nil means use short designation sequence on output.
    ASCII-EOL non-nil means designate ASCII to g0 at end of line on output.
    ASCII-CNTL non-nil means designate ASCII to g0 before control codes and
      SPACE on output.
    SEVEN non-nil means use 7-bit code only on output.
    LOCKING-SHIFT non-nil means use locking-shift.
    SINGLE-SHIFT non-nil means use single-shift.
    USE-ROMAN non-nil means designate JIS0201-1976-Roman instead of ASCII.
    USE-OLDJIS non-nil means designate JIS0208-1976 instead of JIS0208-1983.
    NO-ISO6429 non-nil means not use ISO6429's direction specification.
    INIT-BOL non-nil means any designation state is assumed to be reset
      to initial at each beginning of line on output.
    DESIGNATION-BOL non-nil means designation sequences should be placed
      at beginning of line on output.
    SAFE non-nil means convert unsafe characters to `?' on output.
      Characters not specified in the property `safe-charsets' nor
      `safe-chars' are unsafe.
    ACCEPT-LATIN-EXTRA-CODE non-nil means code-detection routine accepts
      a code specified in `latin-extra-code-table' (which see) as a valid
      code of the coding system.

  If TYPE is 4 (private), FLAGS should be a cons of CCL programs, for
    decoding and encoding.  CCL programs should be specified by their
    symbols.

PROPERTIES is an alist of properties vs the corresponding values.  The
following properties are recognized:

  o post-read-conversion
 
  The value is a function to call after some text is inserted and
  decoded by the coding system itself and before any functions in
  `after-insert-functions' are called.  The argument of this
  function is the same as for a function in
  `after-insert-file-functions', i.e. LENGTH of the text inserted,
  with point at the head of the text to be decoded.
 
  o pre-write-conversion
 
  The value is a function to call after all functions in
  `write-region-annotate-functions' and `buffer-file-format' are
  called, and before the text is encoded by the coding system itself.
  The arguments to this function are the same as those of a function
  in `write-region-annotate-functions', i.e. FROM and TO, specifying
  a region of text.
 
  o translation-table-for-decode
 
  The value is a translation table to be applied on decoding.  See
  the function `make-translation-table' for the format of translation
  table.  This is not applicable to type 4 (CCL-based) coding systems.
 
  o translation-table-for-encode
 
  The value is a translation table to be applied on encoding.  This is
  not applicable to type 4 (CCL-based) coding systems.
 
  o safe-chars
 
  The value is a char table.  If a character has non-nil value in it,
  the character is safely supported by the coding system.  This
  overrides the specification of safe-charsets.

  o safe-charsets

  The value is a list of charsets safely supported by the coding
  system.  The value t means that all charsets Emacs handles are
  supported.  Even if some charset is not in this list, it doesn't
  mean that the charset can't be encoded in the coding system;
  it just means that some other receiver of text encoded
  in the coding system won't be able to handle that charset.
 
  o mime-charset
 
  The value is a symbol of which name is `MIME-charset' parameter of
  the coding system.
 
  o valid-codes (meaningful only for a coding system based on CCL)
 
  The value is a list to indicate valid byte ranges of the encoded
  file.  Each element of the list is an integer or a cons of integer.
  In the former case, the integer value is a valid byte code.  In the
  latter case, the integers specifies the range of valid byte codes.

These properties are set in PLIST, a property list.  This function
also sets properties `coding-category' and `alias-coding-systems'
automatically.

EOL-TYPE specifies the EOL type of the coding-system in one of the
following formats:

  o symbol (unix, dos, or mac)

	The symbol `unix' means Unix-like EOL (LF), `dos' means
	DOS-like EOL (CRLF), and `mac' means MAC-like EOL (CR).

  o number (0, 1, or 2)

	The number 0, 1, and 2 mean UNIX, DOS, and MAC-like EOL
	respectively.

  o vector of coding-systems of length 3

	The EOL type is detected automatically for the coding system.
	And, according to the detected EOL type, one of the coding
	systems in the vector is selected.  Elements of the vector
	corresponds to Unix-like EOL, DOS-like EOL, and Mac-like EOL
	in this order.

Kludgy features for backward compatibility:

1. If TYPE is 4 and car or cdr of FLAGS is a vector, the vector is
treated as a compiled CCL code.

2. If PROPERTIES is just a list of character sets, the list is set as
a value of `safe-charsets' in PLIST.Fdefine-coding-system-alias
Define ALIAS as an alias for coding system CODING-SYSTEM.Fset-buffer-file-coding-system
Set the file coding-system of the current buffer to CODING-SYSTEM.
This means that when you save the buffer, it will be converted
according to CODING-SYSTEM.  For a list of possible values of CODING-SYSTEM,
use \[list-coding-systems].

If the buffer's previous file coding-system value specifies end-of-line
conversion, and CODING-SYSTEM does not specify one, CODING-SYSTEM is
merged with the already-specified end-of-line conversion.

If the buffer's previous file coding-system value specifies text
conversion, and CODING-SYSTEM does not specify one, CODING-SYSTEM is
merged with the already-specified text conversion.

However, if the optional prefix argument FORCE is non-nil, then
CODING-SYSTEM is used exactly as specified.

This marks the buffer modified so that the succeeding \[save-buffer]
surely saves the buffer with CODING-SYSTEM.  From a program, if you
don't want to mark the buffer modified, just set the variable
`buffer-file-coding-system' directly.Vdefault-terminal-coding-system
Default value for the terminal coding system.
This is normally set according to the selected language environment.
See also the command `set-terminal-coding-system'.Fset-terminal-coding-system
Set coding system of your terminal to CODING-SYSTEM.
All text output to the terminal will be encoded
with the specified coding system.
For a list of possible values of CODING-SYSTEM, use \[list-coding-systems].
The default is determined by the selected language environment
or by the previous use of this command.Vdefault-keyboard-coding-system
Default value of the keyboard coding system.
This is normally set according to the selected language environment.
See also the command `set-keyboard-coding-system'.Fset-keyboard-coding-system
Set coding system for keyboard input to CODING-SYSTEM.
In addition, this command enables Encoded-kbd minor mode.
(If CODING-SYSTEM is nil, Encoded-kbd mode is turned off -- see
`encoded-kbd-mode'.)
For a list of possible values of CODING-SYSTEM, use \[list-coding-systems].
The default is determined by the selected language environment
or by the previous use of this command.Vkeyboard-coding-system
Specify coding system for keyboard input.
If you set this on a terminal which can't distinguish Meta keys from
8-bit characters, you will have to use ESC to type Meta characters.
See Info node `Specify Coding' and Info node `Single-Byte Character Support'.

Setting this variable directly does not take effect;
use either M-x customize or \[set-keyboard-coding-system].Fset-buffer-process-coding-system
Set coding systems for the process associated with the current buffer.
DECODING is the coding system to be used to decode input from the process,
ENCODING is the coding system to be used to encode output to the process.

For a list of possible values of CODING-SYSTEM, use \[list-coding-systems].Fset-selection-coding-system
Make CODING-SYSTEM used for communicating with other X clients .
When sending or receiving text via cut_buffer, selection, and clipboard,
the text is encoded or decoded by CODING-SYSTEM.Fset-next-selection-coding-system
Make CODING-SYSTEM used for the next communication with other X clients.
This setting is effective for the next communication only.Fset-coding-priority
Set priority of coding categories according to ARG.
ARG is a list of coding categories ordered by priority.Vauto-coding-alist
Alist of filename patterns vs corresponding coding systems.
Each element looks like (REGEXP . CODING-SYSTEM).
A file whose name matches REGEXP is decoded by CODING-SYSTEM on reading.

The settings in this alist take priority over `coding:' tags
in the file (see the function `set-auto-coding')
and the contents of `file-coding-system-alist'.Vauto-coding-regexp-alist
Alist of patterns vs corresponding coding systems.
Each element looks like (REGEXP . CODING-SYSTEM).
A file whose first bytes match REGEXP is decoded by CODING-SYSTEM on reading.

The settings in this alist take priority over `coding:' tags
in the file (see the function `set-auto-coding')
and the contents of `file-coding-system-alist'.Vset-auto-coding-for-load
Non-nil means look for `load-coding' property instead of `coding'.
This is used for loading and byte-compiling Emacs Lisp files.Fauto-coding-alist-lookup
Return the coding system specified by `auto-coding-alist' for FILENAME.Fauto-coding-from-file-contents
Determine a coding system from the contents of the current buffer.
The current buffer contains SIZE bytes starting at point.
Value is either a coding system or nil.Fset-auto-coding
Return coding system for a file FILENAME of which SIZE bytes follow point.
These bytes should include at least the first 1k of the file
and the last 3k of the file, but the middle may be omitted.

It checks FILENAME against the variable `auto-coding-alist'.  If
FILENAME doesn't match any entries in the variable, it checks the
contents of the current buffer following point against
`auto-coding-regexp-alist'.  If no match is found, it checks for a
`coding:' tag in the first one or two lines following point.  If no
`coding:' tag is found, it checks for local variables list in the last
3K bytes out of the SIZE bytes.

The return value is the specified coding system,
or nil if nothing specified.

The variable `set-auto-coding-function' (which see) is set to this
function by default.Fafter-insert-file-set-buffer-file-coding-system
Set `buffer-file-coding-system' of current buffer after text is inserted.Ffind-new-buffer-file-coding-system
Return a coding system for a buffer when a file of CODING is inserted.
The local variable `buffer-file-coding-system' of the current buffer
is set to the returned value.
Return nil if there's no need to set `buffer-file-coding-system'.Fmodify-coding-system-alist
Modify one of look up tables for finding a coding system on I/O operation.
There are three of such tables, `file-coding-system-alist',
`process-coding-system-alist', and `network-coding-system-alist'.

TARGET-TYPE specifies which of them to modify.
If it is `file', it affects `file-coding-system-alist' (which see).
If it is `process', it affects `process-coding-system-alist' (which see).
If it is `network', it affects `network-coding-system-alist' (which see).

REGEXP is a regular expression matching a target of I/O operation.
The target is a file name if TARGET-TYPE is `file', a program name if
TARGET-TYPE is `process', or a network service name or a port number
to connect to if TARGET-TYPE is `network'.

CODING-SYSTEM is a coding system to perform code conversion on the I/O
operation, or a cons cell (DECODING . ENCODING) specifying the coding systems
for decoding and encoding respectively,
or a function symbol which, when called, returns such a cons cell.Fmake-translation-table
Make a translation table from arguments.
A translation table is a char table intended for character
translation in CCL programs.

Each argument is a list of elements of the form (FROM . TO), where FROM
is a character to be translated to TO.

FROM can be a generic character (see `make-char').  In this case, TO is
a generic character containing the same number of characters, or an
ordinary character.  If FROM and TO are both generic characters, all
characters belonging to FROM are translated to characters belonging to TO
without changing their position code(s).

The arguments and forms in each argument are processed in the given
order, and if a previous form already translates TO to some other
character, say TO-ALT, FROM is also translated to TO-ALT.Fmake-translation-table-from-vector
Make translation table from decoding vector VEC.
VEC is an array of 256 elements to map unibyte codes to multibyte characters.
See also the variable `nonascii-translation-table'.Fdefine-translation-table
Define SYMBOL as the name of translation table made by ARGS.
This sets up information so that the table can be used for
translations in a CCL program.

If the first element of ARGS is a char-table whose purpose is
`translation-table', just define SYMBOL to name it.  (Note that this
function does not bind SYMBOL.)

Any other ARGS should be suitable as arguments of the function
`make-translation-table' (which see).

This function sets properties `translation-table' and
`translation-table-id' of SYMBOL to the created table itself and the
identification number of the table respectively.  It also registers
the table in `translation-table-vector'.Vmule-keymap
Keymap for Mule (Multilingual environment) specific commands.Vmule-menu-keymap
Keymap for Mule (Multilingual environment) menu specific commands.Fcoding-system-change-eol-conversion
Return a coding system which differs from CODING-SYSTEM in eol conversion.
The returned coding system converts end-of-line by EOL-TYPE
but text as the same way as CODING-SYSTEM.
EOL-TYPE should be `unix', `dos', `mac', or nil.
If EOL-TYPE is nil, the returned coding system detects
how end-of-line is formatted automatically while decoding.

EOL-TYPE can be specified by an integer 0, 1, or 2.
They means `unix', `dos', and `mac' respectively.Fcoding-system-change-text-conversion
Return a coding system which differs from CODING-SYSTEM in text conversion.
The returned coding system converts text by CODING
but end-of-line as the same way as CODING-SYSTEM.
If CODING is nil, the returned coding system detects
how text is formatted automatically while decoding.Ftoggle-enable-multibyte-characters
Change whether this buffer uses multibyte characters.
With arg, use multibyte characters if the arg is positive.

Note that this command does not convert the byte contents of
the buffer; it only changes the way those bytes are interpreted.
In general, therefore, this command *changes* the sequence of
characters that the current buffer contains.

We suggest you avoid using use this command unless you know what you
are doing.  If you use it by mistake, and the buffer is now displayed
wrong, use this command again to toggle back to the right mode.Fview-hello-file
Display the HELLO file which list up many languages and characters.Funiversal-coding-system-argument
Execute an I/O command using the specified coding system.Fset-default-coding-systems
Set default value of various coding systems to CODING-SYSTEM.
This sets the following coding systems:
  o coding system of a newly created buffer
  o default coding system for subprocess I/O
This also sets the following values:
  o default value used as file-name-coding-system for converting file names.
  o default value for the command `set-terminal-coding-system' (not on MSDOS)
  o default value for the command `set-keyboard-coding-system'.Fprefer-coding-system
Add CODING-SYSTEM at the front of the priority list for automatic detection.
This also sets the following coding systems:
  o coding system of a newly created buffer
  o default coding system for subprocess I/O
This also sets the following values:
  o default value used as `file-name-coding-system' for converting file names.
  o default value for the command `set-terminal-coding-system' (not on MSDOS)
  o default value for the command `set-keyboard-coding-system'

If CODING-SYSTEM specifies a certain type of EOL conversion, the coding
systems set by this function will use that type of EOL conversion.

This command does not change the default value of terminal coding system
for MS-DOS terminal, because DOS terminals only support a single coding
system, and Emacs automatically sets the default to that coding system at
startup.

A coding system that requires automatic detection of text
encoding (e.g. undecided, unix) can't be preferred.

See also `coding-category-list' and `coding-system-category'.Vsort-coding-systems-predicate
If non-nil, a predicate function to sort coding systems.

It is called with two coding systems, and should return t if the first
one is "less" than the second.

The function `sort-coding-systems' use it.Fsort-coding-systems
Sort coding system list CODINGS by a priority of each coding system.

If a coding system is most preferred, it has the highest priority.
Otherwise, a coding system corresponds to some MIME charset has higher
priorities.  Among them, a coding system included in `coding-system'
key of the current language environment has higher priorities.  See
also the documentation of `language-info-alist'.

If the variable `sort-coding-systems-predicate' (which see) is
non-nil, it is used to sort CODINGS in the different way than above.Ffind-coding-systems-region
Return a list of proper coding systems to encode a text between FROM and TO.
All coding systems in the list can safely encode any multibyte characters
in the text.

If the text contains no multibyte characters, return a list of a single
element `undecided'.Ffind-coding-systems-string
Return a list of proper coding systems to encode STRING.
All coding systems in the list can safely encode any multibyte characters
in STRING.

If STRING contains no multibyte characters, return a list of a single
element `undecided'.Ffind-coding-systems-for-charsets
Return a list of proper coding systems to encode characters of CHARSETS.
CHARSETS is a list of character sets.Ffind-multibyte-characters
Find multibyte characters in the region specified by FROM and TO.
If FROM is a string, find multibyte characters in the string.
The return value is an alist of the following format:
  ((CHARSET COUNT CHAR ...) ...)
where
  CHARSET is a character set,
  COUNT is a number of characters,
  CHARs are found characters of the character set.
Optional 3rd arg MAXCOUNT limits how many CHARs are put in the above list.
Optional 4th arg EXCLUDE is a list of character sets to be ignored.

For invalid characters, CHARs are actually strings.Vlast-coding-system-specified
Most recent coding system explicitly specified by the user when asked.
This variable is set whenever Emacs asks the user which coding system
to use in order to write a file.  If you set it to nil explicitly,
then call `write-region', then afterward this variable will be non-nil
only if the user was explicitly asked and specified a coding system.Vselect-safe-coding-system-accept-default-p
If non-nil, a function to control the behaviour of coding system selection.
The meaning is the same as the argument ACCEPT-DEFAULT-P of the
function `select-safe-coding-system' (which see).  This variable
overrides that argument.Fselect-safe-coding-system
Ask a user to select a safe coding system from candidates.
The candidates of coding systems which can safely encode a text
between FROM and TO are shown in a popup window.  Among them, the most
proper one is suggested as the default.

The list of `buffer-file-coding-system' of the current buffer and the
most preferred coding system (if it corresponds to a MIME charset) is
treated as the default coding system list.  Among them, the first one
that safely encodes the text is silently selected and returned without
any user interaction.  See also the command `prefer-coding-system'.

Optional 3rd arg DEFAULT-CODING-SYSTEM specifies a coding system or a
list of coding systems to be prepended to the default coding system
list.

Optional 4th arg ACCEPT-DEFAULT-P, if non-nil, is a function to
determine the acceptability of the silently selected coding system.
It is called with that coding system, and should return nil if it
should not be silently selected and thus user interaction is required.

The variable `select-safe-coding-system-accept-default-p', if
non-nil, overrides ACCEPT-DEFAULT-P.

Kludgy feature: if FROM is a string, the string is the target text,
and TO is ignored.Fselect-message-coding-system
Return a coding system to encode the outgoing message of the current buffer.
It at first tries the first coding system found in these variables
in this order:
  (1) local value of `buffer-file-coding-system'
  (2) value of `sendmail-coding-system'
  (3) value of `default-sendmail-coding-system'
  (4) value of `default-buffer-file-coding-system'
If the found coding system can't encode the current buffer,
or none of them are bound to a coding system,
it asks the user to select a proper coding system.Vlanguage-info-alist
Alist of language environment definitions.
Each element looks like:
	(LANGUAGE-NAME . ((KEY . INFO) ...))
where LANGUAGE-NAME is a string, the name of the language environment,
KEY is a symbol denoting the kind of information, and
INFO is the data associated with KEY.
Meaningful values for KEY include

  documentation      value is documentation of what this language environment
			is meant for, and how to use it.
  charset	     value is a list of the character sets used by this
			language environment.

			in effect, as a kind of documentation.
  coding-priority    value is a list of coding systems for this language
			environment, in order of decreasing priority.
			This is used to set up the coding system priority
			list when you switch to this language environment.
  nonascii-translation

			variable `nonascii-translation-table' in this
			language environment, or a character set from
			which `nonascii-insert-offset' is calculated.
  input-method       value is a default input method for this language
			environment.
  features           value is a list of features requested in this

The following keys take effect only when multibyte characters are
globally disabled, i.e. the value of `default-enable-multibyte-characters'
is nil.

  unibyte-syntax     value is a library name to load to set
			unibyte 8-bit character syntaxes for this
			language environment.

  unibyte-display    value is a coding system to encode characters
			for the terminal.  Characters in the range
			of 160 to 255 display not as octal escapes,
			but as non-ASCII characters in this language
			environment.Fget-language-info
Return information listed under KEY for language environment LANG-ENV.
KEY is a symbol denoting the kind of information.
For a list of useful values for KEY and their meanings,
see `language-info-alist'.Fset-language-info
Modify part of the definition of language environment LANG-ENV.
Specifically, this stores the information INFO under KEY
in the definition of this language environment.
KEY is a symbol denoting the kind of information.
INFO is the value for that information.

For a list of useful values for KEY and their meanings,
see `language-info-alist'.Fset-language-info-alist
Store ALIST as the definition of language environment LANG-ENV.
ALIST is an alist of KEY and INFO values.  See the documentation of
`language-info-alist' for the meanings of KEY and INFO.

Optional arg PARENTS is a list of parent menu names; it specifies
where to put this language environment in the 
Describe Language Environment and Set Language Environment menus.
For example, ("European") means to put this language environment
in the European submenu in each of those two menus.Fread-language-name
Read a language environment name which has information for KEY.
If KEY is nil, read any language environment.
Prompt with PROMPT.  DEFAULT is the default choice of language environment.
This returns a language environment name as a string.Vleim-list-file-name
Name of LEIM list file.
This file contains a list of libraries of Emacs input methods (LEIM)
in the format of Lisp expression for registering each input method.
Emacs loads this file at startup time.Vleim-list-header
Header to be inserted in LEIM list file.Vleim-list-entry-regexp
Regexp matching head of each entry in LEIM list file.
See also the variable `leim-list-header'Vupdate-leim-list-functions
List of functions to call to update LEIM list file.
Each function is called with one arg, LEIM directory name.Fupdate-leim-list-file
Update LEIM list file in directories DIRS.Vcurrent-input-method
The current input method for multilingual text.
If nil, that means no input method is activated now.Vcurrent-input-method-title
Title string of the current input method shown in mode line.Vdefault-input-method
*Default input method for multilingual text (a string).
This is the input method activated automatically by the command
`toggle-input-method' (\[toggle-input-method]).Vinput-method-history
History list for some commands that read input methods.Vinactivate-current-input-method-function
Function to call for inactivating the current input method.
Every input method should set this to an appropriate value when activated.
This function is called with no argument.

This function should never change the value of `current-input-method'.
It is set to nil by the function `inactivate-input-method'.Vdescribe-current-input-method-function
Function to call for describing the current input method.
This function is called with no argument.Vinput-method-alist
Alist of input method names vs how to use them.
Each element has the form:
   (INPUT-METHOD LANGUAGE-ENV ACTIVATE-FUNC TITLE DESCRIPTION ARGS...)
See the function `register-input-method' for the meanings of the elements.Fregister-input-method
Register INPUT-METHOD as an input method for language environment LANG-ENV.
INPUT-METHOD and LANG-ENV are symbols or strings.

The remaining arguments are:
	ACTIVATE-FUNC, TITLE, DESCRIPTION, and ARGS...
ACTIVATE-FUNC is a function to call to activate this method.
TITLE is a string to show in the mode line when this method is active.
DESCRIPTION is a string describing this method and what it is good for.
The ARGS, if any, are passed as arguments to ACTIVATE-FUNC.
All told, the arguments to ACTIVATE-FUNC are INPUT-METHOD and the ARGS.

This function is mainly used in the file "leim-list.el" which is
created at Emacs build time, registering all Quail input methods
contained in the Emacs distribution.

In case you want to register a new Quail input method by yourself, be
careful to use the same input method title as given in the third
parameter of `quail-define-package'.  (If the values are different, the
string specified in this function takes precedence.)

The commands `describe-input-method' and `list-input-methods' need
these duplicated values to show some information about input methods
without loading the relevant Quail packages.Fread-input-method-name
Read a name of input method from a minibuffer prompting with PROMPT.
If DEFAULT is non-nil, use that as the default,
and substitute it into PROMPT at the first `%s'.
If INHIBIT-NULL is non-nil, null input signals an error.

The return value is a string.Factivate-input-method
Switch to input method INPUT-METHOD for the current buffer.
If some other input method is already active, turn it off first.
If INPUT-METHOD is nil, deactivate any current input method.Finactivate-input-method
Turn off the current input method.Fset-input-method
Select and activate input method INPUT-METHOD for the current buffer.
This also sets the default input method to the one you specify.
If INPUT-METHOD is nil, this function turns off the input method, and
also causes you to be prompted for a name of an input method the next
time you invoke \[toggle-input-method].

To deactivate the input method interactively, use \[toggle-input-method].
To deactivate it programmatically, use \[inactivate-input-method].Ftoggle-input-method
Enable or disable multilingual text input method for the current buffer.
Only one input method can be enabled at any time in a given buffer.

The normal action is to enable an input method if none was
enabled, and disable the current one otherwise.  Which input method
to enable can be determined in various ways--either the one most
recently used, or the one specified by `default-input-method', or
as a last resort by reading the name of an input method in the
minibuffer.

With a prefix argument, read an input method name with the minibuffer
and enable that one.  The default is the most recent input method specified
(not including the currently active input method, if any).Fdescribe-input-method
Describe input method INPUT-METHOD.Fdescribe-current-input-method
Describe the input method currently in use.Fread-multilingual-string
Read a multilingual string from minibuffer, prompting with string PROMPT.
The input method selected last time is activated in minibuffer.
If optional second arg INITIAL-INPUT is non-nil, insert it in the minibuffer
initially.
Optional 3rd argument INPUT-METHOD specifies the input method
to be activated instead of the one selected last time.  It is a symbol
or a string.Vinput-method-verbose-flag
*A flag to control extra guidance given by input methods.
The value should be nil, t, `complex-only', or `default'.

The extra guidance is done by showing list of available keys in echo
area.  When you use the input method in the minibuffer, the guidance
is shown at the bottom short window (split from the existing window).

If the value is t, extra guidance is always given, if the value is
nil, extra guidance is always suppressed.

If the value is `complex-only', only complex input methods such as
`chinese-py' and `japanese' give extra guidance.

If the value is `default', complex input methods always give extra
guidance, but simple input methods give it only when you are not in
the minibuffer.

See also the variable `input-method-highlight-flag'.Vinput-method-highlight-flag
*If this flag is non-nil, input methods highlight partially-entered text.
For instance, while you are in the middle of a Quail input method sequence,
the text inserted so far is temporarily underlined.
The underlining goes away when you finish or abort the input method sequence.
See also the variable `input-method-verbose-flag'.Vinput-method-activate-hook
Normal hook run just after an input method is activated.

The variable `current-input-method' keeps the input method name
just activated.Vinput-method-inactivate-hook
Normal hook run just after an input method is inactivated.

The variable `current-input-method' still keeps the input method name
just inactivated.Vinput-method-after-insert-chunk-hook
Normal hook run just after an input method insert some chunk of text.Vinput-method-exit-on-first-char
This flag controls when an input method returns.
Usually, the input method does not return while there's a possibility
that it may find a different translation if a user types another key.
But, it this flag is non-nil, the input method returns as soon as
the current key sequence gets long enough to have some valid translation.Vinput-method-use-echo-area
This flag controls how an input method shows an intermediate key sequence.
Usually, the input method inserts the intermediate key sequence,
or candidate translations corresponding to the sequence,
at point in the current buffer.
But, if this flag is non-nil, it displays them in echo area instead.Vinput-method-exit-on-invalid-key
This flag controls the behaviour of an input method on invalid key input.
Usually, when a user types a key which doesn't start any character
handled by the input method, the key is handled by turning off the
input method temporarily.  After that key, the input method is re-enabled.
But, if this flag is non-nil, the input method is never back on.Vset-language-environment-hook
Normal hook run after some language environment is set.

When you set some hook function here, that effect usually should not
be inherited to another language environment.  So, you had better set
another function in `exit-language-environment-hook' (which see) to
cancel the effect.Vexit-language-environment-hook
Normal hook run after exiting from some language environment.
When this hook is run, the variable `current-language-environment'
is still bound to the language environment being exited.

This hook is mainly used for canceling the effect of
`set-language-environment-hook' (which-see).Fsetup-specified-language-environment
Switch to a specified language environment.Vcurrent-language-environment
The last language environment specified with `set-language-environment'.
This variable should be set only with \[customize], which is equivalent
to using the function `set-language-environment'.Freset-language-environment
Reset multilingual environment of Emacs to the default status.

The default status is as follows:

  The default value of buffer-file-coding-system is nil.
  The default coding system for process I/O is nil.
  The default value for the command `set-terminal-coding-system' is nil.
  The default value for the command `set-keyboard-coding-system' is nil.

  The order of priorities of coding categories and the coding system
  bound to each category are as follows
	coding category			coding system
	--------------------------------------------------
	coding-category-iso-8-2		iso-latin-1
	coding-category-iso-8-1		iso-latin-1
	coding-category-iso-7-tight	iso-2022-jp

	coding-category-utf-16-be	nil
	coding-category-utf-16-le	nil
	coding-category-utf-8		mule-utf-8Fset-display-table-and-terminal-coding-system
Set up the display table and terminal coding system for LANGUAGE-NAME.Fset-language-environment
Set up multi-lingual environment for using LANGUAGE-NAME.
This sets the coding system priority and the default input method
and sometimes other things.  LANGUAGE-NAME should be a string
which is the name of a language environment.  For example, "Latin-1"
specifies the character set for the major languages of Western Europe.Fset-language-environment-coding-systems
Do various coding system setups for language environment LANGUAGE-NAME.

The optional arg EOL-TYPE specifies the eol-type of the default value
of buffer-file-coding-system set by this function.Fdescribe-specified-language-support
Describe how Emacs supports the specified language environment.Fdescribe-language-environment
Describe how Emacs supports language environment LANGUAGE-NAME.Vlocale-translation-file-name
File name for the system's file of locale-name aliases, or nil if none.Vlocale-language-names

The first element whose locale regexp matches the start of a downcased locale
specifies the language name corresponding to that locale.
If the language name is nil, there is no corresponding language environment.Vlocale-charset-language-names
List of pairs of locale regexps and charset language names.
The first element whose locale regexp matches the start of a downcased locale
specifies the language name whose charsets corresponds to that locale.
This language name is used if its charsets disagree with the charsets of
the language name that would otherwise be used for this locale.Vlocale-preferred-coding-systems
List of pairs of locale regexps and preferred coding systems.
The first element whose locale regexp matches the start of a downcased locale
specifies the coding system to prefer when using that locale.Flocale-name-match
Search for KEY in ALIST, which should be a list of regexp-value pairs.
Return the value corresponding to the first regexp that matches the
start of KEY, or nil if there is no match.Fset-locale-environment
Set up multi-lingual environment for using LOCALE-NAME.
This sets the coding system priority and the default input method
and sometimes other things.  LOCALE-NAME should be a string
which is the name of a locale supported by the system;
often it is of the form xx_XX.CODE, where xx is a language,
XX is a country, and CODE specifies a character set and coding system.
For example, the locale name "ja_JP.EUC" might name a locale
for Japanese in Japan using the `japanese-iso-8bit' coding-system.

If LOCALE-NAME is nil, its value is taken from the environment.

The locale names supported by your system can typically be found in a
directory named `/usr/share/locale' or `/usr/lib/locale'.  LOCALE-NAME
may be translated according to the table specified by
`locale-translation-file-name'.

that will be used as the downcase part of a case table.
It also modifies `standard-syntax-table' to
indicate left and right delimiters.Fset-case-syntax-pair
Make characters UC and LC a pair of inter-case-converting letters.
This sets the entries for characters UC and LC in TABLE, which is a string
that will be used as the downcase part of a case table.

Toggle display of a menu bar on each frame.
This command applies to all frames that exist and frames to be
created in the future.
With a numeric argument, if the argument is positive,
turn on menu bars; otherwise, turn off menu bars.Vgnus-default-nntp-server
The name of the host running an NNTP server.

You may set this variable to nil in your `.emacs' file if you do not wish
the terminal-initialization file to be loaded.Vregister-alist
Alist of elements (NAME . CONTENTS), one for each Emacs register.
NAME is a character (a number).  CONTENTS is a string, number, marker or list.
A list of strings represents a rectangle.
A list of the form (file . NAME) represents the file named NAME.
A list of the form (file-query NAME POSITION) represents position POSITION
 in the file named NAME, but query before visiting it.
A list of the form (WINDOW-CONFIGURATION POSITION)
 represents a saved window configuration plus a saved value of point.
A list of the form (FRAME-CONFIGURATION POSITION)
 represents a saved frame configuration plus a saved value of point.Fget-register
Return contents of Emacs register named REG, or nil if none.Fset-register
Set contents of Emacs register named REGISTER to VALUE.  Returns VALUE.
See the documentation of the variable `register-alist' for possible VALUE.Fpoint-to-register

Store the window configuration of all frames in register REGISTER.
Use \[jump-to-register] to restore the configuration.
Argument is a character, naming the register.Fjump-to-register
Move point to location stored in a register.
If the register contains a file name, find that file.
 (To put a file name in a register, you must use `set-register'.)
If the register contains a window configuration (one frame) or a frame
configuration (all frames), restore that frame or all frames accordingly.
First argument is a character, naming the register.
Optional second arg non-nil (interactively, prefix argument) says to
delete any existing frames that the frame configuration doesn't mention.
(Otherwise, these frames are iconified.)Fnumber-to-register
Store a number in a register.
Two args, NUMBER and REGISTER (a character, naming the register).
If NUMBER is nil, a decimal number is read from the buffer starting
at point, and point moves to the end of that number.
Interactively, NUMBER is the prefix arg (none means nil).Fincrement-register
Add NUMBER to the contents of register REGISTER.
Interactively, NUMBER is the prefix arg.Fview-register
Display what is contained in register named REGISTER.
The Lisp value REGISTER is a character.Finsert-register
Insert contents of register REGISTER.  (REGISTER is a character.)
Normally puts point before and mark after the inserted text.
If optional second arg is non-nil, puts mark before and point after.
Interactively, second arg is non-nil if prefix arg is supplied.Fcopy-to-register
Copy region into register REGISTER.  With prefix arg, delete as well.
Called from program, takes four args: REGISTER, START, END and DELETE-FLAG.
START and END are buffer positions indicating what to copy.Fappend-to-register

Called from program, takes four args: REGISTER, START, END and DELETE-FLAG.
START and END are buffer positions indicating what to prepend.Fcopy-rectangle-to-register
Copy rectangular region into register REGISTER.
With prefix arg, delete as well.
Called from program, takes four args: REGISTER, START, END and DELETE-FLAG.
START and END are buffer positions giving two corners of rectangle.Vcase-replace
*Non-nil means `query-replace' should preserve case in replacements.Vquery-replace-interactive
Non-nil means `query-replace' uses the last search string.
That becomes the "string to replace".Vquery-replace-from-history-variable
History list to use for the FROM argument of `query-replace' commands.
The value of this variable should be a symbol; that symbol
is used as a variable to hold a history list for the strings
or patterns to be replaced.Vquery-replace-to-history-variable
History list to use for the TO argument of `query-replace' commands.
The value of this variable should be a symbol; that symbol
is used as a variable to hold a history list for replacement
strings or patterns.Fquery-replace
Replace some occurrences of FROM-STRING with TO-STRING.
As each match is found, the user must type a character saying
what to do with it.  For directions, type \[help-command] at that time.

In Transient Mark mode, if the mark is active, operate on the contents
of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the end of the buffer.

If `query-replace-interactive' is non-nil, the last incremental search
string is used as FROM-STRING--you don't have to specify it with the
minibuffer.

Replacement transfers the case of the old text to the new text,
if `case-replace' and `case-fold-search'
are non-nil and FROM-STRING has no uppercase letters.
(Preserving case means that if the string matched is all caps, or capitalized,
then its replacement is upcased or capitalized.)

Third arg DELIMITED (prefix arg if interactive), if non-nil, means replace
only matches surrounded by word boundaries.
Fourth and fifth arg START and END specify the region to operate on.

To customize possible responses, change the "bindings" in `query-replace-map'.Fquery-replace-regexp
Replace some things after point matching REGEXP with TO-STRING.
As each match is found, the user must type a character saying
what to do with it.  For directions, type \[help-command] at that time.

In Transient Mark mode, if the mark is active, operate on the contents
of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the end of the buffer.

If `query-replace-interactive' is non-nil, the last incremental search
regexp is used as REGEXP--you don't have to specify it with the
minibuffer.

Preserves case in each replacement if `case-replace' and `case-fold-search'
are non-nil and REGEXP has no uppercase letters.

Third arg DELIMITED (prefix arg if interactive), if non-nil, means replace
only matches surrounded by word boundaries.
Fourth and fifth arg START and END specify the region to operate on.

In TO-STRING, `\&' stands for whatever matched the whole of REGEXP,
and `\=\N' (where N is a digit) stands for
 whatever what matched the Nth `\(...\)' in REGEXP.Fquery-replace-regexp-eval
Replace some things after point matching REGEXP with the result of TO-EXPR.
As each match is found, the user must type a character saying
what to do with it.  For directions, type \[help-command] at that time.

TO-EXPR is a Lisp expression evaluated to compute each replacement.  It may
reference `replace-count' to get the number of replacements already made.
If the result of TO-EXPR is not a string, it is converted to one using
`prin1-to-string' with the NOESCAPE argument (which see).

For convenience, when entering TO-EXPR interactively, you can use `\&' or
`\0' to stand for whatever matched the whole of REGEXP, and `\N' (where
N is a digit) to stand for whatever matched the Nth `\(...\)' in REGEXP.
Use `\#&' or `\#N' if you want a number instead of a string.

In Transient Mark mode, if the mark is active, operate on the contents
of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the end of the buffer.

If `query-replace-interactive' is non-nil, the last incremental search
regexp is used as REGEXP--you don't have to specify it with the
minibuffer.

Preserves case in each replacement if `case-replace' and `case-fold-search'
are non-nil and REGEXP has no uppercase letters.

Third arg DELIMITED (prefix arg if interactive), if non-nil, means replace
only matches that are surrounded by word boundaries.
Fourth and fifth arg START and END specify the region to operate on.Fmap-query-replace-regexp
Replace some matches for REGEXP with various strings, in rotation.
The second argument TO-STRINGS contains the replacement strings,
separated by spaces.  Third arg DELIMITED (prefix arg if interactive),
if non-nil, means replace only matches surrounded by word boundaries.
This command works like `query-replace-regexp' except that each
successive replacement uses the next successive replacement string,
wrapping around from the last such string to the first.

In Transient Mark mode, if the mark is active, operate on the contents
of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the end of the buffer.

Non-interactively, TO-STRINGS may be a list of replacement strings.

If `query-replace-interactive' is non-nil, the last incremental search
regexp is used as REGEXP--you don't have to specify it with the minibuffer.

A prefix argument N says to use each replacement string N times
before rotating to the next.
Fourth and fifth arg START and END specify the region to operate on.Freplace-string
Replace occurrences of FROM-STRING with TO-STRING.
Preserve case in each match if `case-replace' and `case-fold-search'
are non-nil and FROM-STRING has no uppercase letters.
(Preserving case means that if the string matched is all caps, or capitalized,
then its replacement is upcased or capitalized.)

In Transient Mark mode, if the mark is active, operate on the contents
of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the end of the buffer.

Third arg DELIMITED (prefix arg if interactive), if non-nil, means replace
only matches surrounded by word boundaries.
Fourth and fifth arg START and END specify the region to operate on.

If `query-replace-interactive' is non-nil, the last incremental search
string is used as FROM-STRING--you don't have to specify it with the
minibuffer.

This function is usually the wrong thing to use in a Lisp program.
What you probably want is a loop like this:
  (while (search-forward FROM-STRING nil t)
    (replace-match TO-STRING nil t))
which will run faster and will not set the mark or print anything.
(You may need a more complex loop if FROM-STRING can match the null string
and TO-STRING is also null.)Freplace-regexp
Replace things after point matching REGEXP with TO-STRING.
Preserve case in each match if `case-replace' and `case-fold-search'
are non-nil and REGEXP has no uppercase letters.

In Transient Mark mode, if the mark is active, operate on the contents
of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the end of the buffer.

Third arg DELIMITED (prefix arg if interactive), if non-nil, means replace
only matches surrounded by word boundaries.
Fourth and fifth arg START and END specify the region to operate on.

In TO-STRING, `\&' stands for whatever matched the whole of REGEXP,
and `\=\N' (where N is a digit) stands for
 whatever what matched the Nth `\(...\)' in REGEXP.

If `query-replace-interactive' is non-nil, the last incremental search
regexp is used as REGEXP--you don't have to specify it with the minibuffer.

This function is usually the wrong thing to use in a Lisp program.
What you probably want is a loop like this:
  (while (re-search-forward REGEXP nil t)
    (replace-match TO-STRING nil nil))
which will run faster and will not set the mark or print anything.Vregexp-history
History list for some commands that read regular expressions.Fkeep-lines-read-args
Read arguments for `keep-lines' and friends.
Prompt for a regexp with PROMPT.
Value is a list, (REGEXP).Fkeep-lines
Delete all lines except those containing matches for REGEXP.
A match split across lines preserves all the lines it lies in.
Applies to all lines after point.

If REGEXP contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\'),
the matching is case-sensitive.

Second and third arg RSTART and REND specify the region to operate on.

Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, operate
on the contents of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the
end of the buffer.Fflush-lines
Delete lines containing matches for REGEXP.
If a match is split across lines, all the lines it lies in are deleted.
Applies to lines after point.

If REGEXP contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\'),
the matching is case-sensitive.

Second and third arg RSTART and REND specify the region to operate on.

Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, operate
on the contents of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the
end of the buffer.Fhow-many
Print number of matches for REGEXP following point.

If REGEXP contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\'),
the matching is case-sensitive.

Second and third arg RSTART and REND specify the region to operate on.

Interactively, in Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, operate
on the contents of the region.  Otherwise, operate from point to the
end of the buffer.Voccur-mode-map
Keymap for `occur-mode'.Voccur-buffer
Name of buffer for last occur.Voccur-nlines
Number of lines of context to show around matching line.Voccur-command-arguments
Arguments that were given to `occur' when it made this buffer.Foccur-mode
Major mode for output from \[occur].
\<occur-mode-map>Move point to one of the items in this buffer, then use
\[occur-mode-goto-occurrence] to go to the occurrence that the item refers to.
Alternatively, click \[occur-mode-mouse-goto] on an item to go to it.

\{occur-mode-map}

This mode runs the hook `occur-mode-hook', as the final step
during initialization.Foccur-revert-function
Handle `revert-buffer' for *Occur* buffers.Foccur-mode-mouse-goto
In Occur mode, go to the occurrence whose line you click on.Foccur-mode-goto-occurrence
Go to the occurrence the current line describes.Foccur-next
Move to the Nth (default 1) next match in the *Occur* buffer.Foccur-prev
Move to the Nth (default 1) previous match in the *Occur* buffer.Vlist-matching-lines-default-context-lines
*Default number of context lines included around `list-matching-lines' matches.
A negative number means to include that many lines before the match.
A positive number means to include that many lines both before and after.Vlist-matching-lines-face
*Face used by \[list-matching-lines] to show the text that matches.
If the value is nil, don't highlight the matching portions specially.Foccur
Show all lines in the current buffer containing a match for REGEXP.

If a match spreads across multiple lines, all those lines are shown.

Each line is displayed with NLINES lines before and after, or -NLINES
before if NLINES is negative.
NLINES defaults to `list-matching-lines-default-context-lines'.
Interactively it is the prefix arg.

The lines are shown in a buffer named `*Occur*'.
It serves as a menu to find any of the occurrences in this buffer.
\<occur-mode-map>\[describe-mode] in that buffer will explain how.

If REGEXP contains upper case characters (excluding those preceded by `\'),
the matching is case-sensitive.Vquery-replace-help
Help message while in `query-replace'.Vquery-replace-map
Keymap that defines the responses to questions in `query-replace'.
The "bindings" in this map are not commands; they are answers.
The valid answers include `act', `skip', `act-and-show',
`exit', `act-and-exit', `edit', `delete-and-edit', `recenter',
`automatic', `backup', `exit-prefix', and `help'.Freplace-match-string-symbols
Process a list (and any sub-lists), expanding certain symbols.
Symbol  Expands To
N     (match-string N)           (where N is a string of digits)
#N    (string-to-number (match-string N))
&     (match-string 0)
#&    (string-to-number (match-string 0))

Note that these symbols must be preceeded by a backslash in order to
type them.Fperform-replace
Subroutine of `query-replace'.  Its complexity handles interactive queries.
Don't use this in your own program unless you want to query and set the mark
just as `query-replace' does.  Instead, write a simple loop like this:

  (while (re-search-forward "foo[ \t]+bar" nil t)
    (replace-match "foobar" nil nil))

which will run faster and probably do exactly what you want.  Please
see the documentation of `replace-match' to find out how to simulate
`case-replace'.Vquery-replace-highlight
*Non-nil means to highlight words during query replacement.Ffundamental-mode
Major mode not specialized for anything in particular.
Other major modes are defined by comparison with this one.Fnewline
Insert a newline, and move to left margin of the new line if it's blank.
The newline is marked with the text-property `hard'.
With ARG, insert that many newlines.
In Auto Fill mode, if no numeric arg, break the preceding line if it's long.Fopen-line
Insert a newline and leave point before it.
If there is a fill prefix and/or a left-margin, insert them on the new line
if the line would have been blank.
With arg N, insert N newlines.Fsplit-line
Split current line, moving portion beyond point vertically down.Fdelete-indentation
Join this line to previous and fix up whitespace at join.
If there is a fill prefix, delete it from the beginning of this line.
With argument, join this line to following line.Fdelete-blank-lines
On blank line, delete all surrounding blank lines, leaving just one.
On isolated blank line, delete that one.
On nonblank line, delete any immediately following blank lines.Fdelete-trailing-whitespace
Delete all the trailing whitespace across the current buffer.
All whitespace after the last non-whitespace character in a line is deleted.
This respects narrowing, created by \[narrow-to-region] and friends.
A formfeed is not considered whitespace by this function.Fnewline-and-indent
Insert a newline, then indent according to major mode.
Indentation is done using the value of `indent-line-function'.
In programming language modes, this is the same as TAB.
In some text modes, where TAB inserts a tab, this command indents to the
column specified by the function `current-left-margin'.Freindent-then-newline-and-indent
Reindent current line, insert newline, then indent the new line.
Indentation of both lines is done according to the current major mode,
which means calling the current value of `indent-line-function'.
In programming language modes, this is the same as TAB.
In some text modes, where TAB inserts a tab, this indents to the
column specified by the function `current-left-margin'.Fquoted-insert
Read next input character and insert it.
This is useful for inserting control characters.

If the first character you type after this command is an octal digit,
you should type a sequence of octal digits which specify a character code.
Any nondigit terminates the sequence.  If the terminator is a RET,
it is discarded; any other terminator is used itself as input.
The variable `read-quoted-char-radix' specifies the radix for this feature;
set it to 10 or 16 to use decimal or hex instead of octal.

In overwrite mode, this function inserts the character anyway, and
does not handle octal digits specially.  This means that if you use
overwrite as your normal editing mode, you can use this function to
insert characters when necessary.

In binary overwrite mode, this function does overwrite, and octal
digits are interpreted as a character code.  This is intended to be
useful for editing binary files.Fforward-to-indentation
Move forward ARG lines and position at first nonblank character.Fbackward-to-indentation
Move backward ARG lines and position at first nonblank character.Fback-to-indentation
Move point to the first non-whitespace character on this line.Ffixup-whitespace
Fixup white space between objects around point.
Leave one space or none, according to the context.Fdelete-horizontal-space
Delete all spaces and tabs around point.
If BACKWARD-ONLY is non-nil, only delete spaces before point.Fjust-one-space
Delete all spaces and tabs around point, leaving one space.Fbeginning-of-buffer
Move point to the beginning of the buffer; leave mark at previous position.
With arg N, put point N/10 of the way from the beginning.

If the buffer is narrowed, this command uses the beginning and size
of the accessible part of the buffer.

Don't use this command in Lisp programs!
(goto-char (point-min)) is faster and avoids clobbering the mark.Fend-of-buffer
Move point to the end of the buffer; leave mark at previous position.
With arg N, put point N/10 of the way from the end.

If the buffer is narrowed, this command uses the beginning and size
of the accessible part of the buffer.

Don't use this command in Lisp programs!
(goto-char (point-max)) is faster and avoids clobbering the mark.Fmark-whole-buffer
Put point at beginning and mark at end of buffer.
You probably should not use this function in Lisp programs;
it is usually a mistake for a Lisp function to use any subroutine
that uses or sets the mark.Fgoto-line
Goto line ARG, counting from line 1 at beginning of buffer.Fcount-lines-region
Print number of lines and characters in the region.Fwhat-line
Print the current buffer line number and narrowed line number of point.Fcount-lines
Return number of lines between START and END.
This is usually the number of newlines between them,
but can be one more if START is not equal to END
and the greater of them is not at the start of a line.Fwhat-cursor-position
Print info on cursor position (on screen and within buffer).
Also describe the character after point, and give its character code
in octal, decimal and hex.

For a non-ASCII multibyte character, also give its encoding in the
buffer's selected coding system if the coding system encodes the
character safely.  If the character is encoded into one byte, that
code is shown in hex.  If the character is encoded into more than one
byte, just "..." is shown.

In addition, with prefix argument, show details about that character
in *Help* buffer.  See also the command `describe-char-after'.Vread-expression-map
Minibuffer keymap used for reading Lisp expressions.Veval-expression-print-level
*Value to use for `print-level' when printing value in `eval-expression'.Veval-expression-print-length
*Value to use for `print-length' when printing value in `eval-expression'.Veval-expression-debug-on-error
*Non-nil means set `debug-on-error' when evaluating in `eval-expression'.
If nil, don't change the value of `debug-on-error'.Feval-expression
Evaluate EVAL-EXPRESSION-ARG and print value in the echo area.
Value is also consed on to front of the variable `values'.
Optional argument EVAL-EXPRESSION-INSERT-VALUE, if non-nil, means
insert the result into the current buffer instead of printing it in
the echo area.Fedit-and-eval-command
Prompting with PROMPT, let user edit COMMAND and eval result.
COMMAND is a Lisp expression.  Let user edit that expression in
the minibuffer, then read and evaluate the result.Frepeat-complex-command
Edit and re-evaluate last complex command, or ARGth from last.
A complex command is one which used the minibuffer.
The command is placed in the minibuffer as a Lisp form for editing.
The result is executed, repeating the command as changed.
If the command has been changed or is not the most recent previous command
it is added to the front of the command history.
You can use the minibuffer history commands \<minibuffer-local-map>\[next-history-element] and \[previous-history-element]
to get different commands to edit and resubmit.Vminibuffer-history
Default minibuffer history list.
This is used for all minibuffer input
except when an alternate history list is specified.Vminibuffer-history-sexp-flag
Non-nil when doing history operations on `command-history'.
More generally, indicates that the history list being acted on
contains expressions rather than strings.
It is only valid if its value equals the current minibuffer depth,
to handle recursive uses of the minibuffer.Vminibuffer-text-before-history
Text that was in this minibuffer before any history commands.
This is nil if there have not yet been any history commands
in this use of the minibuffer.Fminibuffer-avoid-prompt
A point-motion hook for the minibuffer, that moves point out of the prompt.Vminibuffer-history-case-insensitive-variables
*Minibuffer history variables for which matching should ignore case.
If a history variable is a member of this list, then the
\[previous-matching-history-element] and \[next-matching-history-element] commands ignore case when searching it, regardless of `case-fold-search'.Fprevious-matching-history-element
Find the previous history element that matches REGEXP.
(Previous history elements refer to earlier actions.)
With prefix argument N, search for Nth previous match.
If N is negative, find the next or Nth next match.
Normally, history elements are matched case-insensitively if
`case-fold-search' is non-nil, but an uppercase letter in REGEXP
makes the search case-sensitive.
See also `minibuffer-history-case-insensitive-variables'.Fnext-matching-history-element
Find the next history element that matches REGEXP.
(The next history element refers to a more recent action.)
With prefix argument N, search for Nth next match.
If N is negative, find the previous or Nth previous match.
Normally, history elements are matched case-insensitively if
`case-fold-search' is non-nil, but an uppercase letter in REGEXP
makes the search case-sensitive.Fnext-history-element
Insert the next element of the minibuffer history into the minibuffer.Fprevious-history-element
Inserts the previous element of the minibuffer history into the minibuffer.Fnext-complete-history-element
Get next history element which completes the minibuffer before the point.
The contents of the minibuffer after the point are deleted, and replaced
by the new completion.Fprevious-complete-history-element
Get previous history element which completes the minibuffer before the point.
The contents of the minibuffer after the point are deleted, and replaced
by the new completion.Fminibuffer-prompt-width
Return the display width of the minibuffer prompt.
Return 0 if current buffer is not a mini-buffer.Fminibuffer-prompt-end
Return the buffer position of the end of the minibuffer prompt.
Return (point-min) if current buffer is not a mini-buffer.Fminibuffer-contents
Return the user input in a minbuffer as a string.
The current buffer must be a minibuffer.Fminibuffer-contents-no-properties
Return the user input in a minbuffer as a string, without text-properties.
The current buffer must be a minibuffer.Fdelete-minibuffer-contents
Delete all user input in a minibuffer.
The current buffer must be a minibuffer.Fundo
Undo some previous changes.
Repeat this command to undo more changes.
A numeric argument serves as a repeat count.

In Transient Mark mode when the mark is active, only undo changes within
the current region.  Similarly, when not in Transient Mark mode, just C-u
as an argument limits undo to changes within the current region.Vpending-undo-list
Within a run of consecutive undo commands, list remaining to be undone.Vundo-in-progress
Non-nil while performing an undo.
Some change-hooks test this variable to do something different.Fundo-more
Undo back N undo-boundaries beyond what was already undone recently.
Call `undo-start' to get ready to undo recent changes,
then call `undo-more' one or more times to undo them.Fundo-copy-list
Make a copy of undo list LIST.Fundo-start
Set `pending-undo-list' to the front of the undo list.
The next call to `undo-more' will undo the most recently made change.
If BEG and END are specified, then only undo elements
that apply to text between BEG and END are used; other undo elements
are ignored.  If BEG and END are nil, all undo elements are used.Fundo-make-selective-list
Return a list of undo elements for the region START to END.
The elements come from `buffer-undo-list', but we keep only
the elements inside this region, and discard those outside this region.
If we find an element that crosses an edge of this region,
we stop and ignore all further elements.Fundo-elt-in-region
Determine whether UNDO-ELT falls inside the region START ... END.
If it crosses the edge, we return nil.Fundo-elt-crosses-region
Test whether UNDO-ELT crosses one edge of that region START ... END.
This assumes we have already decided that UNDO-ELT
is not *inside* the region START...END.Vshell-command-history
History list for some commands that read shell commands.Vshell-command-switch
Switch used to have the shell execute its command line argument.Vshell-command-default-error-buffer
*Buffer name for `shell-command' and `shell-command-on-region' error output.
This buffer is used when `shell-command' or 'shell-command-on-region'
is run interactively.  A value of nil means that output to stderr and
stdout will be intermixed in the output stream.Fshell-command
Execute string COMMAND in inferior shell; display output, if any.
With prefix argument, insert the COMMAND's output at point.

If COMMAND ends in ampersand, execute it asynchronously.
The output appears in the buffer `*Async Shell Command*'.
That buffer is in shell mode.

Otherwise, COMMAND is executed synchronously.  The output appears in
the buffer `*Shell Command Output*'.  If the output is short enough to
display in the echo area (which is determined by the variables
`resize-mini-windows' and `max-mini-window-height'), it is shown
there, but it is nonetheless available in buffer `*Shell Command
Output*' even though that buffer is not automatically displayed.  If
there is no output, or if output is inserted in the current buffer,
then `*Shell Command Output*' is deleted.

To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the shell command output, use \[universal-coding-system-argument]
before this command.

Noninteractive callers can specify coding systems by binding
`coding-system-for-read' and `coding-system-for-write'.

The optional second argument OUTPUT-BUFFER, if non-nil,
says to put the output in some other buffer.
If OUTPUT-BUFFER is a buffer or buffer name, put the output there.
If OUTPUT-BUFFER is not a buffer and not nil,
insert output in current buffer.  (This cannot be done asynchronously.)
In either case, the output is inserted after point (leaving mark after it).

If the optional third argument ERROR-BUFFER is non-nil, it is a buffer
or buffer name to which to direct the command's standard error output.
If it is nil, error output is mingled with regular output.
In an interactive call, the variable `shell-command-default-error-buffer'
specifies the value of ERROR-BUFFER.Fdisplay-message-or-buffer
Display MESSAGE in the echo area if possible, otherwise in a pop-up buffer.
MESSAGE may be either a string or a buffer.

A buffer is displayed using `display-buffer' if MESSAGE is too long for
the maximum height of the echo area, as defined by `max-mini-window-height'
if `resize-mini-windows' is non-nil.

Returns either the string shown in the echo area, or when a pop-up
buffer is used, the window used to display it.

If MESSAGE is a string, then the optional argument BUFFER-NAME is the
name of the buffer used to display it in the case where a pop-up buffer
is used, defaulting to `*Message*'.  In the case where MESSAGE is a
string and it is displayed in the echo area, it is not specified whether
the contents are inserted into the buffer anyway.

Optional arguments NOT-THIS-WINDOW and FRAME are as for `display-buffer',
and only used if a buffer is displayed.Fshell-command-on-region
Execute string COMMAND in inferior shell with region as input.
Normally display output (if any) in temp buffer `*Shell Command Output*';
Prefix arg means replace the region with it.  Return the exit code of
COMMAND.

To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the shell command, use \[universal-coding-system-argument]
before this command.  By default, the input (from the current buffer)
is encoded in the same coding system that will be used to save the file,
`buffer-file-coding-system'.  If the output is going to replace the region,
then it is decoded from that same coding system.

The noninteractive arguments are START, END, COMMAND, OUTPUT-BUFFER,
REPLACE, ERROR-BUFFER.  Noninteractive callers can specify coding
systems by binding `coding-system-for-read' and
`coding-system-for-write'.

If the output is short enough to display in the echo area (which is
determined by the variable `max-mini-window-height' if
`resize-mini-windows' is non-nil), it is shown there, but it is
nonetheless available in buffer `*Shell Command Output*' even though
that buffer is not automatically displayed.  If there is no output, or
if output is inserted in the current buffer, then `*Shell Command
Output*' is deleted.

If the optional fourth argument OUTPUT-BUFFER is non-nil,
that says to put the output in some other buffer.
If OUTPUT-BUFFER is a buffer or buffer name, put the output there.
If OUTPUT-BUFFER is not a buffer and not nil,
insert output in the current buffer.
In either case, the output is inserted after point (leaving mark after it).

If REPLACE, the optional fifth argument, is non-nil, that means insert
the output in place of text from START to END, putting point and mark
around it.

If optional sixth argument ERROR-BUFFER is non-nil, it is a buffer
or buffer name to which to direct the command's standard error output.
If it is nil, error output is mingled with regular output.
In an interactive call, the variable `shell-command-default-error-buffer'
specifies the value of ERROR-BUFFER.Fshell-command-to-string
Execute shell command COMMAND and return its output as a string.Vuniversal-argument-map
Keymap used while processing \[universal-argument].Vuniversal-argument-num-events
Number of argument-specifying events read by `universal-argument'.
`universal-argument-other-key' uses this to discard those events
from (this-command-keys), and reread only the final command.Funiversal-argument
Begin a numeric argument for the following command.
Digits or minus sign following \[universal-argument] make up the numeric argument.
\[universal-argument] following the digits or minus sign ends the argument.
\[universal-argument] without digits or minus sign provides 4 as argument.
Repeating \[universal-argument] without digits or minus sign
 multiplies the argument by 4 each time.
For some commands, just \[universal-argument] by itself serves as a flag
which is different in effect from any particular numeric argument.
These commands include \[set-mark-command] and \[start-kbd-macro].Fnegative-argument
Begin a negative numeric argument for the next command.
\[universal-argument] following digits or minus sign ends the argument.Fdigit-argument
Part of the numeric argument for the next command.
\[universal-argument] following digits or minus sign ends the argument.Vinterprogram-cut-function
Function to call to make a killed region available to other programs.

Most window systems provide some sort of facility for cutting and
pasting text between the windows of different programs.
This variable holds a function that Emacs calls whenever text
is put in the kill ring, to make the new kill available to other
programs.

The function takes one or two arguments.
The first argument, TEXT, is a string containing
the text which should be made available.
The second, PUSH, if non-nil means this is a "new" kill;
nil means appending to an "old" kill.Vinterprogram-paste-function
Function to call to get text cut from other programs.

Most window systems provide some sort of facility for cutting and
pasting text between the windows of different programs.
This variable holds a function that Emacs calls to obtain
text that other programs have provided for pasting.

The function should be called with no arguments.  If the function
returns nil, then no other program has provided such text, and the top
of the Emacs kill ring should be used.  If the function returns a
string, that string should be put in the kill ring as the latest kill.

Note that the function should return a string only if a program other
than Emacs has provided a string for pasting; if Emacs provided the
most recent string, the function should return nil.  If it is
difficult to tell whether Emacs or some other program provided the
current string, it is probably good enough to return nil if the string
is equal (according to `string=') to the last text Emacs provided.Vkill-ring
List of killed text sequences.
Since the kill ring is supposed to interact nicely with cut-and-paste
facilities offered by window systems, use of this variable should
interact nicely with `interprogram-cut-function' and
`interprogram-paste-function'.  The functions `kill-new',
`kill-append', and `current-kill' are supposed to implement this
interaction; you may want to use them instead of manipulating the kill
ring directly.Vkill-ring-max
*Maximum length of kill ring before oldest elements are thrown away.Vkill-ring-yank-pointer
The tail of the kill ring whose car is the last thing yanked.Fkill-new
Make STRING the latest kill in the kill ring.
Set the kill-ring-yank pointer to point to it.
If `interprogram-cut-function' is non-nil, apply it to STRING.
Optional second argument REPLACE non-nil means that STRING will replace
the front of the kill ring, rather than being added to the list.Fkill-append
Append STRING to the end of the latest kill in the kill ring.
If BEFORE-P is non-nil, prepend STRING to the kill.
If `interprogram-cut-function' is set, pass the resulting kill to
it.Fcurrent-kill
Rotate the yanking point by N places, and then return that kill.
If N is zero, `interprogram-paste-function' is set, and calling it
returns a string, then that string is added to the front of the
kill ring and returned as the latest kill.
If optional arg DO-NOT-MOVE is non-nil, then don't actually move the
yanking point; just return the Nth kill forward.Vkill-read-only-ok
*Non-nil means don't signal an error for killing read-only text.Fkill-region
Kill between point and mark.
The text is deleted but saved in the kill ring.
The command \[yank] can retrieve it from there.
(If you want to kill and then yank immediately, use \[kill-ring-save].)

If you want to append the killed region to the last killed text,
use \[append-next-kill] before \[kill-region].

If the buffer is read-only, Emacs will beep and refrain from deleting
the text, but put the text in the kill ring anyway.  This means that
you can use the killing commands to copy text from a read-only buffer.

This is the primitive for programs to kill text (as opposed to deleting it).
Supply two arguments, character numbers indicating the stretch of text
 to be killed.
Any command that calls this function is a "kill command".
If the previous command was also a kill command,
the text killed this time appends to the text killed last time
to make one entry in the kill ring.Fcopy-region-as-kill
Save the region as if killed, but don't kill it.
In Transient Mark mode, deactivate the mark.
If `interprogram-cut-function' is non-nil, also save the text for a window
system cut and paste.Fkill-ring-save
Save the region as if killed, but don't kill it.
In Transient Mark mode, deactivate the mark.
If `interprogram-cut-function' is non-nil, also save the text for a window
system cut and paste.

If you want to append the killed line to the last killed text,
use \[append-next-kill] before \[kill-ring-save].

This command is similar to `copy-region-as-kill', except that it gives
visual feedback indicating the extent of the region being copied.Fappend-next-kill
Cause following command, if it kills, to append to previous kill.
The argument is used for internal purposes; do not supply one.Fyank-pop
Replace just-yanked stretch of killed text with a different stretch.
This command is allowed only immediately after a `yank' or a `yank-pop'.
At such a time, the region contains a stretch of reinserted
previously-killed text.  `yank-pop' deletes that text and inserts in its
place a different stretch of killed text.

With no argument, the previous kill is inserted.
With argument N, insert the Nth previous kill.
If N is negative, this is a more recent kill.

The sequence of kills wraps around, so that after the oldest one
comes the newest one.Fyank
Reinsert the last stretch of killed text.
More precisely, reinsert the stretch of killed text most recently
killed OR yanked.  Put point at end, and set mark at beginning.
With just C-u as argument, same but put point at beginning (and mark at end).
With argument N, reinsert the Nth most recently killed stretch of killed
text.
See also the command \[yank-pop].Frotate-yank-pointer
Rotate the yanking point in the kill ring.
With argument, rotate that many kills forward (or backward, if negative).Vbackward-delete-char-untabify-method
*The method for untabifying when deleting backward.
Can be `untabify' -- turn a tab to many spaces, then delete one space;
       `hungry' -- delete all whitespace, both tabs and spaces;
       `all' -- delete all whitespace, including tabs, spaces and newlines;
       nil -- just delete one character.Fbackward-delete-char-untabify
Delete characters backward, changing tabs into spaces.
The exact behavior depends on `backward-delete-char-untabify-method'.
Delete ARG chars, and kill (save in kill ring) if KILLP is non-nil.
Interactively, ARG is the prefix arg (default 1)
and KILLP is t if a prefix arg was specified.Fzap-to-char
Kill up to and including ARG'th occurrence of CHAR.
Case is ignored if `case-fold-search' is non-nil in the current buffer.
Goes backward if ARG is negative; error if CHAR not found.Vkill-whole-line
*If non-nil, `kill-line' with no arg at beg of line kills the whole line.Fkill-line
Kill the rest of the current line; if no nonblanks there, kill thru newline.
With prefix argument, kill that many lines from point.
Negative arguments kill lines backward.
With zero argument, kills the text before point on the current line.

When calling from a program, nil means "no arg",
a number counts as a prefix arg.

To kill a whole line, when point is not at the beginning, type \[beginning-of-line] \[kill-line] \[kill-line].

If `kill-whole-line' is non-nil, then this command kills the whole line
including its terminating newline, when used at the beginning of a line
with no argument.  As a consequence, you can always kill a whole line
by typing \[beginning-of-line] \[kill-line].

If you want to append the killed line to the last killed text,
use \[append-next-kill] before \[kill-line].

If the buffer is read-only, Emacs will beep and refrain from deleting
the line, but put the line in the kill ring anyway.  This means that
you can use this command to copy text from a read-only buffer.Fforward-visible-line
Move forward by ARG lines, ignoring currently invisible newlines only.
If ARG is negative, move backward -ARG lines.
If ARG is zero, move to the beginning of the current line.Fend-of-visible-line
Move to end of current visible line.Finsert-buffer
Insert after point the contents of BUFFER.
Puts mark after the inserted text.
BUFFER may be a buffer or a buffer name.

This function is meant for the user to run interactively.
Don't call it from programs!Fappend-to-buffer
Append to specified buffer the text of the region.
It is inserted into that buffer before its point.

When calling from a program, give three arguments:
BUFFER (or buffer name), START and END.
START and END specify the portion of the current buffer to be copied.Fprepend-to-buffer
Prepend to specified buffer the text of the region.
It is inserted into that buffer after its point.

When calling from a program, give three arguments:
BUFFER (or buffer name), START and END.
START and END specify the portion of the current buffer to be copied.Fcopy-to-buffer
Copy to specified buffer the text of the region.
It is inserted into that buffer, replacing existing text there.

When calling from a program, give three arguments:
BUFFER (or buffer name), START and END.
START and END specify the portion of the current buffer to be copied.Fmark
Return this buffer's mark value as integer; error if mark inactive.
If optional argument FORCE is non-nil, access the mark value
even if the mark is not currently active, and return nil
if there is no mark at all.

If you are using this in an editing command, you are most likely making
a mistake; see the documentation of `set-mark'.Fdeactivate-mark
Deactivate the mark by setting `mark-active' to nil.
(That makes a difference only in Transient Mark mode.)
Also runs the hook `deactivate-mark-hook'.Fset-mark
Set this buffer's mark to POS.  Don't use this function!
That is to say, don't use this function unless you want
the user to see that the mark has moved, and you want the previous
mark position to be lost.

Normally, when a new mark is set, the old one should go on the stack.
This is why most applications should use push-mark, not set-mark.

Novice Emacs Lisp programmers often try to use the mark for the wrong
purposes.  The mark saves a location for the user's convenience.
Most editing commands should not alter the mark.
To remember a location for internal use in the Lisp program,
store it in a Lisp variable.  Example:

   (let ((beg (point))) (forward-line 1) (delete-region beg (point))).Vmark-ring
The list of former marks of the current buffer, most recent first.Vmark-ring-max
*Maximum size of mark ring.  Start discarding off end if gets this big.Vglobal-mark-ring
The list of saved global marks, most recent first.Vglobal-mark-ring-max
*Maximum size of global mark ring.  Start discarding off end if gets this big.Fset-mark-command
Set mark at where point is, or jump to mark.
With no prefix argument, set mark, push old mark position on local mark
ring, and push mark on global mark ring.
With argument, jump to mark, and pop a new position for mark off the ring
(does not affect global mark ring).

Novice Emacs Lisp programmers often try to use the mark for the wrong
purposes.  See the documentation of `set-mark' for more information.Fpush-mark
Set mark at LOCATION (point, by default) and push old mark on mark ring.
If the last global mark pushed was not in the current buffer,
also push LOCATION on the global mark ring.
Display `Mark set' unless the optional second arg NOMSG is non-nil.
In Transient Mark mode, activate mark if optional third arg ACTIVATE non-nil.

Novice Emacs Lisp programmers often try to use the mark for the wrong
purposes.  See the documentation of `set-mark' for more information.

In Transient Mark mode, this does not activate the mark.Fpop-mark
Pop off mark ring into the buffer's actual mark.
Does not set point.  Does nothing if mark ring is empty.Fexchange-point-and-mark
Put the mark where point is now, and point where the mark is now.
This command works even when the mark is not active,
and it reactivates the mark.Ftransient-mark-mode
Toggle Transient Mark mode.
With arg, turn Transient Mark mode on if arg is positive, off otherwise.

In Transient Mark mode, when the mark is active, the region is highlighted.
Changing the buffer "deactivates" the mark.
So do certain other operations that set the mark
but whose main purpose is something else--for example,
incremental search, \[beginning-of-buffer], and \[end-of-buffer].

You can also deactivate the mark by typing \[keyboard-quit] or
\[keyboard-escape-quit].

Many commands change their behavior when Transient Mark mode is in effect
and the mark is active, by acting on the region instead of their usual
default part of the buffer's text.  Examples of such commands include
\[comment-dwim], \[flush-lines], \[ispell], \[keep-lines],
\[query-replace], \[query-replace-regexp], and \[undo].  Invoke
\[apropos-documentation] and type "transient" or "mark.*active" at
the prompt, to see the documentation of commands which are sensitive to
the Transient Mark mode.Fpop-global-mark
Pop off global mark ring and jump to the top location.Vnext-line-add-newlines
*If non-nil, `next-line' inserts newline to avoid `end of buffer' error.Fnext-line
Move cursor vertically down ARG lines.
If there is no character in the target line exactly under the current column,
the cursor is positioned after the character in that line which spans this
column, or at the end of the line if it is not long enough.
If there is no line in the buffer after this one, behavior depends on the
value of `next-line-add-newlines'.  If non-nil, it inserts a newline character
to create a line, and moves the cursor to that line.  Otherwise it moves the
cursor to the end of the buffer.

The command \[set-goal-column] can be used to create
a semipermanent goal column for this command.
Then instead of trying to move exactly vertically (or as close as possible),
this command moves to the specified goal column (or as close as possible).
The goal column is stored in the variable `goal-column', which is nil
when there is no goal column.

If you are thinking of using this in a Lisp program, consider
using `forward-line' instead.  It is usually easier to use
and more reliable (no dependence on goal column, etc.).Fprevious-line
Move cursor vertically up ARG lines.
If there is no character in the target line exactly over the current column,
the cursor is positioned after the character in that line which spans this
column, or at the end of the line if it is not long enough.

The command \[set-goal-column] can be used to create
a semipermanent goal column for this command.
Then instead of trying to move exactly vertically (or as close as possible),
this command moves to the specified goal column (or as close as possible).
The goal column is stored in the variable `goal-column', which is nil
when there is no goal column.

If you are thinking of using this in a Lisp program, consider using
`forward-line' with a negative argument instead.  It is usually easier
to use and more reliable (no dependence on goal column, etc.).Vtrack-eol
*Non-nil means vertical motion starting at end of line keeps to ends of lines.
This means moving to the end of each line moved onto.
The beginning of a blank line does not count as the end of a line.Vgoal-column
*Semipermanent goal column for vertical motion, as set by \[set-goal-column], or nil.Vtemporary-goal-column
Current goal column for vertical motion.
It is the column where point was
at the start of current run of vertical motion commands.
When the `track-eol' feature is doing its job, the value is 9999.Vline-move-ignore-invisible
*Non-nil means \[next-line] and \[previous-line] ignore invisible lines.
Outline mode sets this.Fset-goal-column
Set the current horizontal position as a goal for \[next-line] and \[previous-line].
Those commands will move to this position in the line moved to
rather than trying to keep the same horizontal position.
With a non-nil argument, clears out the goal column
so that \[next-line] and \[previous-line] resume vertical motion.
The goal column is stored in the variable `goal-column'.Fscroll-other-window-down
Scroll the "other window" down.
For more details, see the documentation for `scroll-other-window'.Fbeginning-of-buffer-other-window
Move point to the beginning of the buffer in the other window.
Leave mark at previous position.
With arg N, put point N/10 of the way from the true beginning.Fend-of-buffer-other-window
Move point to the end of the buffer in the other window.
Leave mark at previous position.
With arg N, put point N/10 of the way from the true end.Ftranspose-chars
Interchange characters around point, moving forward one character.
With prefix arg ARG, effect is to take character before point
and drag it forward past ARG other characters (backward if ARG negative).
If no argument and at end of line, the previous two chars are exchanged.Ftranspose-words
Interchange words around point, leaving point at end of them.
With prefix arg ARG, effect is to take word before or around point
and drag it forward past ARG other words (backward if ARG negative).
If ARG is zero, the words around or after point and around or after mark
are interchanged.Ftranspose-sexps
Like \[transpose-words] but applies to sexps.
Does not work on a sexp that point is in the middle of
if it is a list or string.Ftranspose-lines
Exchange current line and previous line, leaving point after both.
With argument ARG, takes previous line and moves it past ARG lines.
With argument 0, interchanges line point is in with line mark is in.Fbackward-word
Move backward until encountering the beginning of a word.
With argument, do this that many times.Fmark-word
Set mark arg words away from point.Fkill-word
Kill characters forward until encountering the end of a word.
With argument, do this that many times.Fbackward-kill-word
Kill characters backward until encountering the end of a word.
With argument, do this that many times.Fcurrent-word
Return the word point is on (or a nearby word) as a string.
If optional arg STRICT is non-nil, return nil unless point is within
or adjacent to a word.Vfill-prefix
*String for filling to insert at front of new line, or nil for none.
Setting this variable automatically makes it local to the current buffer.Vauto-fill-inhibit-regexp
*Regexp to match lines which should not be auto-filled.Vcomment-line-break-function
*Mode-specific function which line breaks and continues a comment.

This function is only called during auto-filling of a comment section.
The function should take a single optional argument, which is a flag
indicating whether it should use soft newlines.

Setting this variable automatically makes it local to the current buffer.Vnormal-auto-fill-function
The function to use for `auto-fill-function' if Auto Fill mode is turned on.
Some major modes set this.Fauto-fill-mode
Toggle Auto Fill mode.
With arg, turn Auto Fill mode on if and only if arg is positive.
In Auto Fill mode, inserting a space at a column beyond `current-fill-column'
automatically breaks the line at a previous space.

The value of `normal-auto-fill-function' specifies the function to use
for `auto-fill-function' when turning Auto Fill mode on.Fauto-fill-function
Automatically break line at a previous space, in insertion of text.Fturn-on-auto-fill
Unconditionally turn on Auto Fill mode.Fturn-off-auto-fill
Unconditionally turn off Auto Fill mode.Fset-fill-column
Set `fill-column' to specified argument.
Use \[universal-argument] followed by a number to specify a column.
Just \[universal-argument] as argument means to use the current column.Fset-selective-display
Set `selective-display' to ARG; clear it if no arg.
When the value of `selective-display' is a number > 0,
lines whose indentation is >= that value are not displayed.
The variable `selective-display' has a separate value for each buffer.Voverwrite-mode-textual
The string displayed in the mode line when in overwrite mode.Voverwrite-mode-binary
The string displayed in the mode line when in binary overwrite mode.Foverwrite-mode
Toggle overwrite mode.
With arg, turn overwrite mode on iff arg is positive.
In overwrite mode, printing characters typed in replace existing text
on a one-for-one basis, rather than pushing it to the right.  At the
end of a line, such characters extend the line.  Before a tab,
such characters insert until the tab is filled in.
\[quoted-insert] still inserts characters in overwrite mode; this
is supposed to make it easier to insert characters when necessary.Fbinary-overwrite-mode
Toggle binary overwrite mode.
With arg, turn binary overwrite mode on iff arg is positive.
In binary overwrite mode, printing characters typed in replace
existing text.  Newlines are not treated specially, so typing at the
end of a line joins the line to the next, with the typed character
between them.  Typing before a tab character simply replaces the tab
with the character typed.
\[quoted-insert] replaces the text at the cursor, just as ordinary
typing characters do.

Note that binary overwrite mode is not its own minor mode; it is a
specialization of overwrite-mode, entered by setting the
`overwrite-mode' variable to `overwrite-mode-binary'.Vline-number-mode
*Non-nil means display line number in mode line.Fline-number-mode
Toggle Line Number mode.
With arg, turn Line Number mode on iff arg is positive.
When Line Number mode is enabled, the line number appears
in the mode line.

Line numbers do not appear for very large buffers and buffers
with very long lines; see variables `line-number-display-limit'
and `line-number-display-limit-width'.Vcolumn-number-mode
*Non-nil means display column number in mode line.Fcolumn-number-mode
Toggle Column Number mode.
With arg, turn Column Number mode on iff arg is positive.
When Column Number mode is enabled, the column number appears
in the mode line.Vblink-matching-paren
*Non-nil means show matching open-paren when close-paren is inserted.Vblink-matching-paren-on-screen
*Non-nil means show matching open-paren when it is on screen.
If nil, means don't show it (but the open-paren can still be shown
when it is off screen).Vblink-matching-paren-distance
*If non-nil, is maximum distance to search for matching open-paren.Vblink-matching-delay
*Time in seconds to delay after showing a matching paren.Vblink-matching-paren-dont-ignore-comments
*Non-nil means `blink-matching-paren' will not ignore comments.Fblink-matching-open
Move cursor momentarily to the beginning of the sexp before point.Fkeyboard-quit
Signal a `quit' condition.
During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly.
At top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.Vbuffer-quit-function
Function to call to "quit" the current buffer, or nil if none.
\[keyboard-escape-quit] calls this function when its more local actions
(such as cancelling a prefix argument, minibuffer or region) do not apply.Fkeyboard-escape-quit
Exit the current "mode" (in a generalized sense of the word).
This command can exit an interactive command such as `query-replace',
can clear out a prefix argument or a region,
can get out of the minibuffer or other recursive edit,
cancel the use of the current buffer (for special-purpose buffers),
or go back to just one window (by deleting all but the selected window).Vread-mail-command
*Your preference for a mail reading package.
This is used by some keybindings which support reading mail.
See also `mail-user-agent' concerning sending mail.Vmail-user-agent
*Your preference for a mail composition package.
Various Emacs Lisp packages (e.g. Reporter) require you to compose an
outgoing email message.  This variable lets you specify which
mail-sending package you prefer.

Valid values include:

  `sendmail-user-agent' -- use the default Emacs Mail package.
                           See Info node `(emacs)Sending Mail'.
  `mh-e-user-agent'     -- use the Emacs interface to the MH mail system.
                           See Info node `(mh-e)'.
  `message-user-agent'  -- use the Gnus Message package.
                           See Info node `(message)'.
  `gnus-user-agent'     -- like `message-user-agent', but with Gnus
                           paraphernalia, particularly the Gcc: header for
                           archiving.

Additional valid symbols may be available; check with the author of
your package for details.  The function should return non-nil if it
succeeds.

See also `read-mail-command' concerning reading mail.Fdefine-mail-user-agent
Define a symbol to identify a mail-sending package for `mail-user-agent'.

SYMBOL can be any Lisp symbol.  Its function definition and/or
value as a variable do not matter for this usage; we use only certain
properties on its property list, to encode the rest of the arguments.

COMPOSEFUNC is program callable function that composes an outgoing
mail message buffer.  This function should set up the basics of the
buffer without requiring user interaction.  It should populate the
standard mail headers, leaving the `to:' and `subject:' headers blank
by default.

COMPOSEFUNC should accept several optional arguments--the same
arguments that `compose-mail' takes.  See that function's documentation.

SENDFUNC is the command a user would run to send the message.

Optional ABORTFUNC is the command a user would run to abort the
message.  For mail packages that don't have a separate abort function,
this can be `kill-buffer' (the equivalent of omitting this argument).

Optional HOOKVAR is a hook variable that gets run before the message
is actually sent.  Callers that use the `mail-user-agent' may
install a hook function temporarily on this hook variable.
If HOOKVAR is nil, `mail-send-hook' is used.

The properties used on SYMBOL are `composefunc', `sendfunc',
`abortfunc', and `hookvar'.Fcompose-mail
Start composing a mail message to send.
This uses the user's chosen mail composition package
as selected with the variable `mail-user-agent'.
The optional arguments TO and SUBJECT specify recipients
and the initial Subject field, respectively.

OTHER-HEADERS is an alist specifying additional
header fields.  Elements look like (HEADER . VALUE) where both
HEADER and VALUE are strings.

CONTINUE, if non-nil, says to continue editing a message already
being composed.

SWITCH-FUNCTION, if non-nil, is a function to use to
switch to and display the buffer used for mail composition.

YANK-ACTION, if non-nil, is an action to perform, if and when necessary,
to insert the raw text of the message being replied to.
It has the form (FUNCTION . ARGS).  The user agent will apply
FUNCTION to ARGS, to insert the raw text of the original message.
(The user agent will also run `mail-citation-hook', *after* the
original text has been inserted in this way.)

SEND-ACTIONS is a list of actions to call when the message is sent.
Each action has the form (FUNCTION . ARGS).Fcompose-mail-other-window
Like \[compose-mail], but edit the outgoing message in another window.Fcompose-mail-other-frame
Like \[compose-mail], but edit the outgoing message in another frame.Vset-variable-value-history
History of values entered with `set-variable'.Fset-variable
Set VARIABLE to VALUE.  VALUE is a Lisp object.
When using this interactively, enter a Lisp object for VALUE.
If you want VALUE to be a string, you must surround it with doublequotes.
VALUE is used literally, not evaluated.

If VARIABLE has a `variable-interactive' property, that is used as if
it were the arg to `interactive' (which see) to interactively read VALUE.

If VARIABLE has been defined with `defcustom', then the type information
in the definition is used to check that VALUE is valid.Vcompletion-list-mode-map
Local map for completion list buffers.Vcompletion-reference-buffer
Record the buffer that was current when the completion list was requested.
This is a local variable in the completion list buffer.
Initial value is nil to avoid some compiler warnings.Vcompletion-no-auto-exit
Non-nil means `choose-completion-string' should never exit the minibuffer.
This also applies to other functions such as `choose-completion'
and `mouse-choose-completion'.Vcompletion-base-size
Number of chars at beginning of minibuffer not involved in completion.
This is a local variable in the completion list buffer
but it talks about the buffer in `completion-reference-buffer'.
If this is nil, it means to compare text to determine which part
of the tail end of the buffer's text is involved in completion.Fdelete-completion-window
Delete the completion list window.
Go to the window from which completion was requested.Fprevious-completion
Move to the previous item in the completion list.Fnext-completion
Move to the next item in the completion list.
With prefix argument N, move N items (negative N means move backward).Fchoose-completion
Choose the completion that point is in or next to.Fcompletion-list-mode
Major mode for buffers showing lists of possible completions.
Type \<completion-list-mode-map>\[choose-completion] in the completion list to select the completion near point.
Use \<completion-list-mode-map>\[mouse-choose-completion] to select one with the mouse.Fcompletion-list-mode-finish
Finish setup of the completions buffer.
Called from `temp-buffer-show-hook'.Vcompletion-setup-hook
Normal hook run at the end of setting up a completion list buffer.
When this hook is run, the current buffer is the one in which the
command to display the completion list buffer was run.
The completion list buffer is available as the value of `standard-output'.Fswitch-to-completions
Select the completion list window.Fevent-apply-alt-modifier
Add the Alt modifier to the following event.
For example, type \[event-apply-alt-modifier] & to enter Alt-&.Fevent-apply-super-modifier
Add the Super modifier to the following event.
For example, type \[event-apply-super-modifier] & to enter Super-&.Fevent-apply-hyper-modifier
Add the Hyper modifier to the following event.
For example, type \[event-apply-hyper-modifier] & to enter Hyper-&.Fevent-apply-shift-modifier
Add the Shift modifier to the following event.
For example, type \[event-apply-shift-modifier] & to enter Shift-&.Fevent-apply-control-modifier
Add the Ctrl modifier to the following event.
For example, type \[event-apply-control-modifier] & to enter Ctrl-&.Fevent-apply-meta-modifier
Add the Meta modifier to the following event.
For example, type \[event-apply-meta-modifier] & to enter Meta-&.Fevent-apply-modifier
Apply a modifier flag to event EVENT.
SYMBOL is the name of this modifier, as a symbol.
LSHIFTBY is the numeric value of this modifier, in keyboard events.
PREFIX is the string that represents this modifier in an event type symbol.Vclone-buffer-hook
Normal hook to run in the new buffer at the end of `clone-buffer'.Fclone-process
Create a twin copy of PROCESS.
If NEWNAME is nil, it defaults to PROCESS' name;
NEWNAME is modified by adding or incrementing <N> at the end as necessary.
If PROCESS is associated with a buffer, the new process will be associated
  with the current buffer instead.
Returns nil if PROCESS has already terminated.Fclone-buffer
Create a twin copy of the current buffer.
If NEWNAME is nil, it defaults to the current buffer's name;
NEWNAME is modified by adding or incrementing <N> at the end as necessary.

If DISPLAY-FLAG is non-nil, the new buffer is shown with `pop-to-buffer'.
This runs the normal hook `clone-buffer-hook' in the new buffer
after it has been set up properly in other respects.Fclone-indirect-buffer
Create an indirect buffer that is a twin copy of the current buffer.

Give the indirect buffer name NEWNAME.  Interactively, read NEW-NAME
from the minibuffer when invoked with a prefix arg.  If NEWNAME is nil
or if not called with a prefix arg, NEWNAME defaults to the current
buffer's name.  The name is modified by adding a `<N>' suffix to it
or by incrementing the N in an existing suffix.

DISPLAY-FLAG non-nil means show the new buffer with `pop-to-buffer'.
This is always done when called interactively.

Optional last arg NORECORD non-nil means do not put this buffer at the
front of the list of recently selected ones.Fclone-indirect-buffer-other-window
Create an indirect buffer that is a twin copy of BUFFER.
Select the new buffer in another window.
Optional second arg NORECORD non-nil means do not put this buffer at
the front of the list of recently selected ones.Vsyntax-code-table
Alist of forms (CHAR CODE DESCRIPTION) mapping characters to syntax info.
CHAR is a character that is allowed as first char in the string
specifying the syntax when calling `modify-syntax-entry'.  CODE is the
corresponing syntax code as it is stored in a syntax cell, and
can be used as value of a `syntax-table' property.
DESCRIPTION is the descriptive string for the syntax.Vnormal-erase-is-backspace
If non-nil, Delete key deletes forward and Backspace key deletes backward.

On window systems, the default value of this option is chosen
according to the keyboard used.  If the keyboard has both a Backspace
key and a Delete key, and both are mapped to their usual meanings, the
option's default value is set to t, so that Backspace can be used to
delete backward, and Delete can be used to delete forward.

If not running under a window system, customizing this option accomplishes
a similar effect by mapping C-h, which is usually generated by the
Backspace key, to DEL, and by mapping DEL to C-d via
`keyboard-translate'.  The former functionality of C-h is available on
the F1 key.  You should probably not use this setting if you don't
have both Backspace, Delete and F1 keys.

Setting this variable with setq doesn't take effect.  Programmatically,
call `normal-erase-is-backspace-mode' (which see) instead.Fnormal-erase-is-backspace-mode
Toggle the Erase and Delete mode of the Backspace and Delete keys.

With numeric arg, turn the mode on if and only if ARG is positive.

On window systems, when this mode is on, Delete is mapped to C-d and
Backspace is mapped to DEL; when this mode is off, both Delete and
Backspace are mapped to DEL.  (The remapping goes via
`function-key-map', so binding Delete or Backspace in the global or
local keymap will override that.)

In addition, on window systems, the bindings of C-Delete, M-Delete,
C-M-Delete, C-Backspace, M-Backspace, and C-M-Backspace are changed in
the global keymap in accordance with the functionality of Delete and
Backspace.  For example, if Delete is remapped to C-d, which deletes
forward, C-Delete is bound to `kill-word', but if Delete is remapped
to DEL, which deletes backward, C-Delete is bound to
`backward-kill-word'.

If not running on a window system, a similar effect is accomplished by
remapping C-h (normally produced by the Backspace key) and DEL via
`keyboard-translate': if this mode is on, C-h is mapped to DEL and DEL
to C-d; if it's off, the keys are not remapped.

When not running on a window system, and this mode is turned on, the
former functionality of C-h is available on the F1 key.  You should
probably not turn on this mode on a text-only terminal if you don't
have both Backspace, Delete and F1 keys.

See also `normal-erase-is-backspace'.Fbyte-compiling-files-p
Return t if currently byte-compiling files.Vcommand-line-processed
Non-nil once command line has been processedVinhibit-startup-message
*Non-nil inhibits the initial startup message.
This is for use in your personal init file, once you are familiar
with the contents of the startup message.Vinhibit-startup-echo-area-message
*Non-nil inhibits the initial startup echo area message.
Setting this variable takes effect
only if you do it with the customization buffer
or if your `.emacs' file contains a line of this form:
 (setq inhibit-startup-echo-area-message "YOUR-USER-NAME")
If your `.emacs' file is byte-compiled, use the following form instead:
 (eval '(setq inhibit-startup-echo-area-message "YOUR-USER-NAME"))
Thus, someone else using a copy of your `.emacs' file will see
the startup message unless he personally acts to inhibit it.Vinhibit-default-init
*Non-nil inhibits loading the `default' library.Vcommand-switch-alist
Alist of command-line switches.
Elements look like (SWITCH-STRING . HANDLER-FUNCTION).
HANDLER-FUNCTION receives switch name as sole arg;
remaining command-line args are in the variable `command-line-args-left'.Vcommand-line-args-left
List of command-line args not yet processed.Vcommand-line-functions
List of functions to process unrecognized command-line arguments.
Each function should access the dynamically bound variables
`argi' (the current argument) and `command-line-args-left' (the remaining
arguments).  The function should return non-nil only if it recognizes and
processes `argi'.  If it does so, it may consume successive arguments by
altering `command-line-args-left' to remove them.Vcommand-line-default-directory
Default directory to use for command line arguments.
This is normally copied from `default-directory' when Emacs starts.Vcommand-line-x-option-alist
Alist of X Windows options.
Each element has the form
  (NAME NUMARGS HANDLER FRAME-PARAM VALUE)
where NAME is the option name string, NUMARGS is the number of arguments
that the option accepts, HANDLER is a function to call to handle the option.
FRAME-PARAM (optional) is the frame parameter this option specifies,
and VALUE is the value which is given to that frame parameter
(most options use the argument for this, so VALUE is not present).Vbefore-init-hook
Normal hook run after handling urgent options but before loading init files.Vafter-init-hook
Normal hook run after loading the init files, `~/.emacs' and `default.el'.
There is no `condition-case' around the running of these functions;
therefore, if you set `debug-on-error' non-nil in `.emacs',
an error in one of these functions will invoke the debugger.Vemacs-startup-hook
Normal hook run after loading init files and handling the command line.Vterm-setup-hook
Normal hook run after loading terminal-specific Lisp code.
It also follows `emacs-startup-hook'.  This hook exists for users to set,
so as to override the definitions made by the terminal-specific file.
Emacs never sets this variable itself.Vkeyboard-type
The brand of keyboard you are using.
This variable is used to define
the proper function and keypad keys for use under X.  It is used in a
fashion analogous to the environment variable TERM.Vwindow-setup-hook
Normal hook run to initialize window system display.
Emacs runs this hook after processing the command line arguments and loading
the user's init file.Vinitial-major-mode
Major mode command symbol to use for the initial *scratch* buffer.Vinit-file-user
Identity of user whose `.emacs' file is or was read.
The value is nil if `-q' or `--no-init-file' was specified,
meaning do not load any init file.

Otherwise, the value may be the null string, meaning use the init file
for the user that originally logged in, or it may be a
string containing a user's name meaning use that person's init file.

In either of the latter cases, `(concat "~" init-file-user "/")'
evaluates to the name of the directory where the `.emacs' file was
looked for.

Setting `init-file-user' does not prevent Emacs from loading
`site-start.el'.  The only way to do that is to use `--no-site-file'.Vsite-run-file
File containing site-wide run-time initializations.
This file is loaded at run-time before `~/.emacs'.  It contains inits
that need to be in place for the entire site, but which, due to their
higher incidence of change, don't make sense to load into emacs'
dumped image.  Thus, the run-time load order is: 1. file described in
this variable, if non-nil; 2. `~/.emacs'; 3. `default.el'.

Don't use the `site-start.el' file for things some users may not like.
Put them in `default.el' instead, so that users can more easily
override them.  Users can prevent loading `default.el' with the `-q'
option or by setting `inhibit-default-init' in their own init files,
but inhibiting `site-start.el' requires `--no-site-file', which
is less convenient.Vmail-host-address
*Name of this machine, for purposes of naming users.Vuser-mail-address
*Full mailing address of this user.
This is initialized based on `mail-host-address',
after your init file is read, in case it sets `mail-host-address'.Vauto-save-list-file-prefix
Prefix for generating `auto-save-list-file-name'.
This is used after reading your `.emacs' file to initialize
`auto-save-list-file-name', by appending Emacs's pid and the system name,
if you have not already set `auto-save-list-file-name' yourself.
Directories in the prefix will be created if necessary.
Set this to nil if you want to prevent `auto-save-list-file-name'
from being initialized.Fnormal-top-level-add-subdirs-to-load-path
Add all subdirectories of current directory to `load-path'.
More precisely, this uses only the subdirectories whose names
start with letters or digits; it excludes any subdirectory named `RCS'
or `CVS', and any subdirectory that contains a file named `.nosearch'.Vtool-bar-images-pixel-height
Height in pixels of images in the tool bar.Vtool-bar-originally-present
Non-nil if tool-bars are present before user and site init files are read.Vinitial-scratch-message
Initial message displayed in *scratch* buffer at startup.
If this is nil, no message will be displayed.Vfancy-splash-text
A list of texts to show in the middle part of splash screens.
Each element in the list should be a list of strings or pairs
`:face FACE', like `fancy-splash-insert' accepts them.Vfancy-splash-delay
*Delay in seconds between splash screens.Vfancy-splash-max-time
*Show splash screens for at most this number of seconds.
Values less than 60 seconds are ignored.Vfancy-splash-image
*The image to show in the splash screens, or nil for defaults.Ffancy-splash-insert
Insert text into the current buffer, with faces.
Arguments from ARGS should be either strings or pairs `:face FACE',
where FACE is a valid face specification, as it can be used with
`put-text-properties'.Ffancy-splash-head
Insert the head part of the splash screen into the current buffer.Ffancy-splash-tail
Insert the tail part of the splash screen into the current buffer.Ffancy-splash-screens-1
Timer function displaying a splash screen.Ffancy-splash-default-action
Default action for events in the splash screen buffer.Ffancy-splash-screens
Display fancy splash screens when Emacs starts.Fuse-fancy-splash-screens-p
Return t if fancy splash screens should be used.Fcommand-line-normalize-file-name
Collapse multiple slashes to one, to handle non-Emacs file names.Vcustom-declare-variable-list
Record `defcustom' calls made before `custom.el' is loaded to handle them.
Each element of this list holds the arguments to one call to `defcustom'.Flambda
Return a lambda expression.
A call of the form (lambda ARGS DOCSTRING INTERACTIVE BODY) is
self-quoting; the result of evaluating the lambda expression is the
expression itself.  The lambda expression may then be treated as a
function, i.e., stored as the function value of a symbol, passed to
funcall or mapcar, etc.

ARGS should take the same form as an argument list for a `defun'.
DOCSTRING is an optional documentation string.
 If present, it should describe how to call the function.
 But documentation strings are usually not useful in nameless functions.
INTERACTIVE should be a call to the function `interactive', which see.
It may also be omitted.
BODY should be a list of lisp expressions.Fpush
Add NEWELT to the list stored in the symbol LISTNAME.
This is equivalent to (setq LISTNAME (cons NEWELT LISTNAME)).
LISTNAME must be a symbol.Fpop
Return the first element of LISTNAME's value, and remove it from the list.
LISTNAME must be a symbol whose value is a list.
If the value is nil, `pop' returns nil but does not actually
change the list.Fwhen
If COND yields non-nil, do BODY, else return nil.Funless
If COND yields nil, do BODY, else return nil.Fdolist
(dolist (VAR LIST [RESULT]) BODY...): loop over a list.
Evaluate BODY with VAR bound to each car from LIST, in turn.
Then evaluate RESULT to get return value, default nil.Fdotimes
(dotimes (VAR COUNT [RESULT]) BODY...): loop a certain number of times.
Evaluate BODY with VAR bound to successive integers running from 0,
inclusive, to COUNT, exclusive.  Then evaluate RESULT to get
the return value (nil if RESULT is omitted).Fcaar
Return the car of the car of X.Fcadr
Return the car of the cdr of X.Fcdar
Return the cdr of the car of X.Fcddr
Return the cdr of the cdr of X.Flast
Return the last link of the list X.  Its car is the last element.
If X is nil, return nil.
If N is non-nil, return the Nth-to-last link of X.
If N is bigger than the length of X, return X.Fbutlast
Returns a copy of LIST with the last N elements removed.Fnbutlast
Modifies LIST to remove the last N elements.Fremove
Return a copy of SEQ with all occurences of ELT removed.
SEQ must be a list, vector, or string.  The comparison is done with `equal'.Fremq
Return a copy of LIST with all occurences of ELT removed.
The comparison is done with `eq'.Fassoc-default
Find object KEY in a pseudo-alist ALIST.
ALIST is a list of conses or objects.  Each element (or the element's car,
if it is a cons) is compared with KEY by evaluating (TEST (car elt) KEY).
If that is non-nil, the element matches;
then `assoc-default' returns the element's cdr, if it is a cons,
or DEFAULT if the element is not a cons.

If no element matches, the value is nil.
If TEST is omitted or nil, `equal' is used.Fassoc-ignore-case
Like `assoc', but ignores differences in case and text representation.
KEY must be a string.  Upper-case and lower-case letters are treated as equal.
Unibyte strings are converted to multibyte for comparison.Fassoc-ignore-representation
Like `assoc', but ignores differences in text representation.
KEY must be a string.  
Unibyte strings are converted to multibyte for comparison.Fmember-ignore-case
Like `member', but ignores differences in case and text representation.
ELT must be a string.  Upper-case and lower-case letters are treated as equal.
Unibyte strings are converted to multibyte for comparison.Fsuppress-keymap
Make MAP override all normally self-inserting keys to be undefined.
Normally, as an exception, digits and minus-sign are set to make prefix args,
but optional second arg NODIGITS non-nil treats them like other chars.Vkey-substitution-in-progress
Used internally by substitute-key-definition.Fsubstitute-key-definition
Replace OLDDEF with NEWDEF for any keys in KEYMAP now defined as OLDDEF.
In other words, OLDDEF is replaced with NEWDEF where ever it appears.
Alternatively, if optional fourth argument OLDMAP is specified, we redefine
in KEYMAP as NEWDEF those keys which are defined as OLDDEF in OLDMAP.Fdefine-key-after
Add binding in KEYMAP for KEY => DEFINITION, right after AFTER's binding.
This is like `define-key' except that the binding for KEY is placed
just after the binding for the event AFTER, instead of at the beginning
of the map.  Note that AFTER must be an event type (like KEY), NOT a command
(like DEFINITION).

If AFTER is t or omitted, the new binding goes at the end of the keymap.

KEY must contain just one event type--that is to say, it must be a
string or vector of length 1, but AFTER should be a single event
type--a symbol or a character, not a sequence.

Bindings are always added before any inherited map.

The order of bindings in a keymap matters when it is used as a menu.Fkbd
Convert KEYS to the internal Emacs key representation.
KEYS should be a string constant in the format used for
saving keyboard macros (see `insert-kbd-macro').Fkeyboard-translate
Translate character FROM to TO at a low level.
This function creates a `keyboard-translate-table' if necessary
and then modifies one entry in it.Vglobal-map
Default global keymap mapping Emacs keyboard input into commands.
The value is a keymap which is usually (but not necessarily) Emacs's
global map.Vesc-map
Default keymap for ESC (meta) commands.
The normal global definition of the character ESC indirects to this keymap.Vctl-x-map
Default keymap for C-x commands.
The normal global definition of the character C-x indirects to this keymap.Vctl-x-4-map
Keymap for subcommands of C-x 4Vctl-x-5-map
Keymap for frame commands.Flistify-key-sequence
Convert a key sequence to a list of events.Feventp
True if the argument is an event object.Fevent-modifiers
Returns a list of symbols representing the modifier keys in event EVENT.
The elements of the list may include `meta', `control',
`shift', `hyper', `super', `alt', `click', `double', `triple', `drag',
and `down'.Fevent-basic-type
Returns the basic type of the given event (all modifiers removed).
The value is a printing character (not upper case) or a symbol.Fmouse-movement-p
Return non-nil if OBJECT is a mouse movement event.Fevent-start
Return the starting position of EVENT.
If EVENT is a mouse press or a mouse click, this returns the location
of the event.
If EVENT is a drag, this returns the drag's starting position.
The return value is of the form
   (WINDOW BUFFER-POSITION (X . Y) TIMESTAMP)
The `posn-' functions access elements of such lists.Fevent-end
Return the ending location of EVENT.  EVENT should be a click or drag event.
If EVENT is a click event, this function is the same as `event-start'.
The return value is of the form
   (WINDOW BUFFER-POSITION (X . Y) TIMESTAMP)
The `posn-' functions access elements of such lists.Fevent-click-count
Return the multi-click count of EVENT, a click or drag event.
The return value is a positive integer.Fposn-window
Return the window in POSITION.
POSITION should be a list of the form
   (WINDOW BUFFER-POSITION (X . Y) TIMESTAMP)
as returned by the `event-start' and `event-end' functions.Fposn-point
Return the buffer location in POSITION.
POSITION should be a list of the form
   (WINDOW BUFFER-POSITION (X . Y) TIMESTAMP)
as returned by the `event-start' and `event-end' functions.Fposn-x-y
Return the x and y coordinates in POSITION.
POSITION should be a list of the form
   (WINDOW BUFFER-POSITION (X . Y) TIMESTAMP)
as returned by the `event-start' and `event-end' functions.Fposn-col-row
Return the column and row in POSITION, measured in characters.
POSITION should be a list of the form
   (WINDOW BUFFER-POSITION (X . Y) TIMESTAMP)
as returned by the `event-start' and `event-end' functions.
For a scroll-bar event, the result column is 0, and the row
corresponds to the vertical position of the click in the scroll bar.Fposn-timestamp
Return the timestamp of POSITION.
POSITION should be a list of the form
   (WINDOW BUFFER-POSITION (X . Y) TIMESTAMP)
as returned by the `event-start' and `event-end' functions.Fbaud-rate
Obsolete function returning the value of the `baud-rate' variable.
Please convert your programs to use the variable `baud-rate' directly.Fmake-local-hook
Make the hook HOOK local to the current buffer.
The return value is HOOK.

You never need to call this function now that `add-hook' does it for you
if its LOCAL argument is non-nil.

When a hook is local, its local and global values
work in concert: running the hook actually runs all the hook
functions listed in *either* the local value *or* the global value
of the hook variable.

This function works by making `t' a member of the buffer-local value,
which acts as a flag to run the hook functions in the default value as
well.  This works for all normal hooks, but does not work for most
non-normal hooks yet.  We will be changing the callers of non-normal
hooks so that they can handle localness; this has to be done one by
one.

This function does nothing if HOOK is already local in the current
buffer.

Do not use `make-local-variable' to make a hook variable buffer-local.Fadd-hook
Add to the value of HOOK the function FUNCTION.
FUNCTION is not added if already present.
FUNCTION is added (if necessary) at the beginning of the hook list
unless the optional argument APPEND is non-nil, in which case
FUNCTION is added at the end.

The optional fourth argument, LOCAL, if non-nil, says to modify
the hook's buffer-local value rather than its default value.
This makes the hook buffer-local if needed.
To make a hook variable buffer-local, always use
`make-local-hook', not `make-local-variable'.

HOOK should be a symbol, and FUNCTION may be any valid function.  If
HOOK is void, it is first set to nil.  If HOOK's value is a single
function, it is changed to a list of functions.Fremove-hook
Remove from the value of HOOK the function FUNCTION.
HOOK should be a symbol, and FUNCTION may be any valid function.  If
FUNCTION isn't the value of HOOK, or, if FUNCTION doesn't appear in the
list of hooks to run in HOOK, then nothing is done.  See `add-hook'.

The optional third argument, LOCAL, if non-nil, says to modify
the hook's buffer-local value rather than its default value.
This makes the hook buffer-local if needed.
To make a hook variable buffer-local, always use
`make-local-hook', not `make-local-variable'.Fadd-to-list
Add to the value of LIST-VAR the element ELEMENT if it isn't there yet.
The test for presence of ELEMENT is done with `equal'.
If ELEMENT is added, it is added at the beginning of the list,
unless the optional argument APPEND is non-nil, in which case
ELEMENT is added at the end.

If you want to use `add-to-list' on a variable that is not defined
until a certain package is loaded, you should put the call to `add-to-list'
into a hook function that will be run only after loading the package.
`eval-after-load' provides one way to do this.  In some cases
other hooks, such as major mode hooks, can do the job.Feval-after-load
Arrange that, if FILE is ever loaded, FORM will be run at that time.
This makes or adds to an entry on `after-load-alist'.
If FILE is already loaded, evaluate FORM right now.
It does nothing if FORM is already on the list for FILE.
FILE must match exactly.  Normally FILE is the name of a library,
with no directory or extension specified, since that is how `load'
is normally called.Feval-next-after-load
Read the following input sexp, and run it whenever FILE is loaded.
This makes or adds to an entry on `after-load-alist'.
FILE should be the name of a library, with no directory name.Vread-quoted-char-radix
*Radix for \[quoted-insert] and other uses of `read-quoted-char'.
Legitimate radix values are 8, 10 and 16.Fread-quoted-char
Like `read-char', but do not allow quitting.
Also, if the first character read is an octal digit,
we read any number of octal digits and return the
specified character code.  Any nondigit terminates the sequence.
If the terminator is RET, it is discarded;
any other terminator is used itself as input.

The optional argument PROMPT specifies a string to use to prompt the user.
The variable `read-quoted-char-radix' controls which radix to use
for numeric input.Fread-passwd
Read a password, prompting with PROMPT.  Echo `.' for each character typed.
End with RET, LFD, or ESC.  DEL or C-h rubs out.  C-u kills line.
Optional argument CONFIRM, if non-nil, then read it twice to make sure.
Optional DEFAULT is a default password to use instead of empty input.Fforce-mode-line-update
Force the mode-line of the current buffer to be redisplayed.
With optional non-nil ALL, force redisplay of all mode-lines.Fmomentary-string-display
Momentarily display STRING in the buffer at POS.
Display remains until next character is typed.
If the char is EXIT-CHAR (optional third arg, default is SPC) it is swallowed;
otherwise it is then available as input (as a command if nothing else).
Display MESSAGE (optional fourth arg) in the echo area.
If MESSAGE is nil, instructions to type EXIT-CHAR are displayed there.Vsuspend-hook
Normal hook run by `suspend-emacs', before suspending.Vsuspend-resume-hook
Normal hook run by `suspend-emacs', after Emacs is continued.Vbuffer-file-type
Non-nil if the visited file is a binary file.
This variable is meaningful on MS-DOG and Windows NT.
On those systems, it is automatically local in every buffer.
On other systems, this variable is normally always nil.Fget-buffer-window-list
Return windows currently displaying BUFFER, or nil if none.
See `walk-windows' for the meaning of MINIBUF and FRAME.Fignore
Do nothing and return nil.
This function accepts any number of arguments, but ignores them.Ferror
Signal an error, making error message by passing all args to `format'.
In Emacs, the convention is that error messages start with a capital
letter but *do not* end with a period.  Please follow this convention
for the sake of consistency.Fstart-process-shell-command
Start a program in a subprocess.  Return the process object for it.
Args are NAME BUFFER COMMAND &rest COMMAND-ARGS.
NAME is name for process.  It is modified if necessary to make it unique.
BUFFER is the buffer or (buffer-name) to associate with the process.
 Process output goes at end of that buffer, unless you specify
 an output stream or filter function to handle the output.
 BUFFER may be also nil, meaning that this process is not associated
 with any buffer
Third arg is command name, the name of a shell command.
Remaining arguments are the arguments for the command.
Wildcards and redirection are handled as usual in the shell.Fwith-current-buffer
Execute the forms in BODY with BUFFER as the current buffer.
The value returned is the value of the last form in BODY.
See also `with-temp-buffer'.Fwith-temp-file
Create a new buffer, evaluate BODY there, and write the buffer to FILE.
The value returned is the value of the last form in BODY.
See also `with-temp-buffer'.Fwith-temp-message
Display MESSAGE temporarily if non-nil while BODY is evaluated.
The original message is restored to the echo area after BODY has finished.
The value returned is the value of the last form in BODY.
MESSAGE is written to the message log buffer if `message-log-max' is non-nil.
If MESSAGE is nil, the echo area and message log buffer are unchanged.
Use a MESSAGE of "" to temporarily clear the echo area.Fwith-temp-buffer
Create a temporary buffer, and evaluate BODY there like `progn'.
See also `with-temp-file' and `with-output-to-string'.Fwith-output-to-string
Execute BODY, return the text it sent to `standard-output', as a string.Fcombine-after-change-calls
Execute BODY, but don't call the after-change functions till the end.
If BODY makes changes in the buffer, they are recorded
and the functions on `after-change-functions' are called several times
when BODY is finished.
The return value is the value of the last form in BODY.

If `before-change-functions' is non-nil, then calls to the after-change
functions can't be deferred, so in that case this macro has no effect.

Do not alter `after-change-functions' or `before-change-functions'
in BODY.Fwith-syntax-table
Evaluate BODY with syntax table of current buffer set to a copy of TABLE.
The syntax table of the current buffer is saved, BODY is evaluated, and the
saved table is restored, even in case of an abnormal exit.
Value is what BODY returns.Fsave-match-data
Execute the BODY forms, restoring the global value of the match data.Fmatch-string
Return string of text matched by last search.
NUM specifies which parenthesized expression in the last regexp.
 Value is nil if NUMth pair didn't match, or there were less than NUM pairs.
Zero means the entire text matched by the whole regexp or whole string.
STRING should be given if the last search was by `string-match' on STRING.Fmatch-string-no-properties
Return string of text matched by last search, without text properties.
NUM specifies which parenthesized expression in the last regexp.
 Value is nil if NUMth pair didn't match, or there were less than NUM pairs.
Zero means the entire text matched by the whole regexp or whole string.
STRING should be given if the last search was by `string-match' on STRING.Fsplit-string
Splits STRING into substrings where there are matches for SEPARATORS.
Each match for SEPARATORS is a splitting point.
The substrings between the splitting points are made into a list
which is returned.
If SEPARATORS is absent, it defaults to "[ \f\t\n\r\v]+".

If there is match for SEPARATORS at the beginning of STRING, we do not
include a null substring for that.  Likewise, if there is a match
at the end of STRING, we don't include a null substring for that.

Modifies the match data; use `save-match-data' if necessary.Fsubst-char-in-string
Replace FROMCHAR with TOCHAR in STRING each time it occurs.
Unless optional argument INPLACE is non-nil, return a new string.Freplace-regexp-in-string
Replace all matches for REGEXP with REP in STRING.

Return a new string containing the replacements.

Optional arguments FIXEDCASE, LITERAL and SUBEXP are like the
arguments with the same names of function `replace-match'.  If START
is non-nil, start replacements at that index in STRING.

REP is either a string used as the NEWTEXT arg of `replace-match' or a
function.  If it is a function it is applied to each match to generate
the replacement passed to `replace-match'; the match-data at this
point are such that match 0 is the function's argument.

To replace only the first match (if any), make REGEXP match up to \'
and replace a sub-expression, e.g.
  (replace-regexp-in-string "\(foo\).*\'" "bar" " foo foo" nil nil 1)
    => " bar foo"
Fshell-quote-argument
Quote an argument for passing as argument to an inferior shell.Fmake-syntax-table
Return a new syntax table.
If OLDTABLE is non-nil, copy OLDTABLE.
Otherwise, create a syntax table which inherits
all letters and control characters from the standard syntax table;
other characters are copied from the standard syntax table.Fadd-to-invisibility-spec
Add elements to `buffer-invisibility-spec'.
See documentation for `buffer-invisibility-spec' for the kind of elements
that can be added.Fremove-from-invisibility-spec
Remove elements from `buffer-invisibility-spec'.Fglobal-set-key
Give KEY a global binding as COMMAND.
COMMAND is the command definition to use; usually it is
a symbol naming an interactively-callable function.
KEY is a key sequence; noninteractively, it is a string or vector
of characters or event types, and non-ASCII characters with codes
above 127 (such as ISO Latin-1) can be included if you use a vector.

Note that if KEY has a local binding in the current buffer,
that local binding will continue to shadow any global binding
that you make with this function.Flocal-set-key
Give KEY a local binding as COMMAND.
COMMAND is the command definition to use; usually it is
a symbol naming an interactively-callable function.
KEY is a key sequence; noninteractively, it is a string or vector
of characters or event types, and non-ASCII characters with codes
above 127 (such as ISO Latin-1) can be included if you use a vector.

The binding goes in the current buffer's local map,
which in most cases is shared with all other buffers in the same major mode.Fglobal-unset-key
Remove global binding of KEY.
KEY is a string representing a sequence of keystrokes.Flocal-unset-key
Remove local binding of KEY.
KEY is a string representing a sequence of keystrokes.Fframe-configuration-p
Return non-nil if OBJECT seems to be a frame configuration.
Any list whose car is `frame-configuration' is assumed to be a frame
configuration.Ffunctionp
Non-nil if OBJECT is a type of object that can be called as a function.Finteractive-form
Return the interactive form of FUNCTION.
If function is a command (see `commandp'), value is a list of the form
(interactive SPEC).  If function is not a command, return nil.Fassq-delete-all
Delete from ALIST all elements whose car is KEY.
Return the modified alist.Fmake-temp-file
Create a temporary file.
The returned file name (created by appending some random characters at the end
of PREFIX, and expanding against `temporary-file-directory' if necessary,
is guaranteed to point to a newly created empty file.
You can then use `write-region' to write new data into the file.

If DIR-FLAG is non-nil, create a new empty directory instead of a file.Fadd-minor-mode
Register a new minor mode.

This is an XEmacs-compatibility function.  Use `define-minor-mode' instead.

TOGGLE is a symbol which is the name of a buffer-local variable that
is toggled on or off to say whether the minor mode is active or not.

NAME specifies what will appear in the mode line when the minor mode
is active.  NAME should be either a string starting with a space, or a
symbol whose value is such a string.

Optional KEYMAP is the keymap for the minor mode that will be added
to `minor-mode-map-alist'.

Optional AFTER specifies that TOGGLE should be added after AFTER
in `minor-mode-alist'.

Optional TOGGLE-FUN is an interactive function to toggle the mode.
It defaults to (and should by convention be) TOGGLE.

If TOGGLE has a non-nil `:included' property, an entry for the mode is
included in the mode-line minor mode menu.
If TOGGLE has a `:menu-tag', that is used for the menu item's label.Vcolor-name-rgb-alist
An alist of X color names and associated 8-bit RGB values.Vtty-standard-colors
An alist of 8 standard tty colors, their indices and RGB values.Vtty-defined-color-alist
An alist of defined terminal colors and their RGB values.

See the docstring of `tty-color-alist' for the details.Ftty-color-alist
Return an alist of colors supported by FRAME's terminal.
FRAME defaults to the selected frame.
Each element of the returned alist is of the form:
 (NAME INDEX R G B)
where NAME is the name of the color, a string;
INDEX is the index of this color to be sent to the terminal driver
when the color should be displayed; it is typically a small integer;
R, G, and B are the intensities of, accordingly, red, green, and blue
components of the color, represented as numbers between 0 and 65535.
The file `etc/rgb.txt' in the Emacs distribution lists the standard
RGB values of the X colors.  If RGB is nil, this color will not be
considered by `tty-color-translate' as an approximation to another
color.Ftty-modify-color-alist
Put the association ELT int the alist of terminal colors for FRAME.
ELT should be of the form  (NAME INDEX R G B) (see `tty-color-alist'
for details).
If FRAME is unspecified or nil, it defaults to the selected frame.
Value is the modified color alist for FRAME.Ftty-color-canonicalize
Return COLOR in canonical form.
A canonicalized color name is all-lower case, with any blanks removed.Ftty-color-define
Specify a tty color by its NAME, terminal INDEX and RGB values.
NAME is a string, INDEX is typically a small integer used to send to
the terminal driver a command to switch this color on, and RGB is a
list of 3 numbers that specify the intensity of red, green, and blue
components of the color.
If specified, each one of the RGB components must be a number between
0 and 65535.  If RGB is omitted, the specified color will never be used
by `tty-color-translate' as an approximation to another color.
FRAME is the frame where the defined color should be used.
If FRAME is not specified or is nil, it defaults to the selected frame.Ftty-color-clear
Clear the list of supported tty colors for frame FRAME.
If FRAME is unspecified or nil, it defaults to the selected frame.Ftty-color-off-gray-diag
Compute the angle between the color given by R,G,B and the gray diagonal.
The gray diagonal is the diagonal of the 3D cube in RGB space which
connects the points corresponding to the black and white colors.  All the
colors whose RGB coordinates belong to this diagonal are various shades
of gray, thus the name.Ftty-color-approximate
Given a list of 3 rgb values in RGB, find the color in `tty-color-alist'
which is the best approximation in the 3-dimensional RGB space,
and return the index associated with the approximating color.
Each value of the RGB triplet has to be scaled to the 0..255 range.
FRAME defaults to the selected frame.Ftty-color-translate
Given a color COLOR, return the index of the corresponding TTY color.

COLOR must be a string that is either the color's name, or its X-style
specification like "#RRGGBB" or "RGB:rr/gg/bb", where each primary.
color can be given with 1 to 4 hex digits.

If COLOR is a color name that is found among supported colors in
`tty-color-alist', the associated index is returned.  Otherwise, the
RGB values of the color, either as given by the argument or from
looking up the name in `color-name-rgb-alist', are used to find the
supported color that is the best approximation for COLOR in the RGB
space.
If COLOR is neither a valid X RGB specification of the color, nor a
name of a color in `color-name-rgb-alist', the returned value is nil.

If FRAME is unspecified or nil, it defaults to the selected frame.Ftty-color-by-index
Given a numeric index of a tty color, return its description.

FRAME, if unspecified or nil, defaults to the selected frame.
Value is a list of the form (NAME INDEX R G B).Ftty-color-values
Return RGB values of the color COLOR on a termcap frame FRAME.

If COLOR is not directly supported by the display, return the RGB
values for a supported color that is its best approximation.
The value is a list of integer RGB values--(RED GREEN BLUE).
These values range from 0 to 65535; white is (65535 65535 65535).
If FRAME is omitted or nil, use the selected frame.Ftty-color-desc
Return the description of the color COLOR for a character terminal.

FRAME, if unspecified or nil, defaults to the selected frame.
Value is a list of the form (NAME INDEX R G B).  Note that the returned
NAME is not necessarily the same string as the argument COLOR, because
the latter might need to be approximated if it is not supported directly.Ftty-color-gray-shades
Return the number of gray colors supported by DISPLAY's terminal.
A color is considered gray if the 3 components of its RGB value are equal.Vfill-individual-varying-indent
*Controls criterion for a new paragraph in `fill-individual-paragraphs'.
Non-nil means changing indent doesn't end a paragraph.
That mode can handle paragraphs with extra indentation on the first line,
but it requires separator lines between paragraphs.
A value of nil means that any change in indentation starts a new paragraph.Vsentence-end-double-space
*Non-nil means a single space does not end a sentence.
This is relevant for filling.  See also `sentence-end-without-period'
and `colon-double-space'.

If you change this, you should also change `sentence-end'.  See Info
node `Sentences'.Vcolon-double-space
*Non-nil means put two spaces after a colon when filling.Vsentence-end-without-period
*Non-nil means a sentence will end without a period.
For example, a sentence in Thai text ends with double space but
without a period.Vfill-paragraph-function
Mode-specific function to fill a paragraph, or nil if there is none.
If the function returns nil, then `fill-paragraph' does its normal work.Venable-kinsoku
*Non-nil means enable "kinsoku" processing on filling paragraph.
Kinsoku processing is designed to prevent certain characters from being
placed at the beginning or end of a line by filling.
See the documentation of `kinsoku' for more information.Fset-fill-prefix
Set the fill prefix to the current line up to point.
Filling expects lines to start with the fill prefix and
reinserts the fill prefix in each resulting line.Vadaptive-fill-mode
*Non-nil means determine a paragraph's fill prefix from its text.Vadaptive-fill-regexp
*Regexp to match text at start of line that constitutes indentation.
If Adaptive Fill mode is enabled, a prefix matching this pattern
on the first and second lines of a paragraph is used as the
standard indentation for the whole paragraph.

If the paragraph has just one line, the indentation is taken from that
line, but in that case `adaptive-fill-first-line-regexp' also plays
a role.Vadaptive-fill-first-line-regexp
*Regexp specifying whether to set fill prefix from a one-line paragraph.
When a paragraph has just one line, then after `adaptive-fill-regexp'
finds the prefix at the beginning of the line, if it doesn't
match this regexp, it is replaced with whitespace.

By default, this regexp matches sequences of just spaces and tabs.

However, we never use a prefix from a one-line paragraph
if it would act as a paragraph-starter on the second line.Vadaptive-fill-function
*Function to call to choose a fill prefix for a paragraph, or nil.
This function is used when `adaptive-fill-regexp' does not match.Vfill-indent-according-to-mode
Whether or not filling should try to use the major mode's indentation.Fcurrent-fill-column
Return the fill-column to use for this line.
The fill-column to use for a buffer is stored in the variable `fill-column',
but can be locally modified by the `right-margin' text property, which is
subtracted from `fill-column'.

The fill column to use for a line is the first column at which the column
number equals or exceeds the local fill-column - right-margin difference.Fcanonically-space-region
Remove extra spaces between words in region.
Leave one space between words, two at end of sentences or after colons
(depending on values of `sentence-end-double-space', `colon-double-space',
and `sentence-end-without-period').
Remove indentation from each line.Ffill-common-string-prefix
Return the longest common prefix of strings S1 and S2, or nil if none.Ffill-context-prefix
Compute a fill prefix from the text between FROM and TO.
This uses the variables `adaptive-fill-regexp' and `adaptive-fill-function'
and `adaptive-fill-first-line-regexp'.  `paragraph-start' also plays a role;
we reject a prefix based on a one-line paragraph if that prefix would
act as a paragraph-separator.Vfill-nobreak-predicate
If non-nil, a predicate for recognizing places not to break a line.
The predicate is called with no arguments, with point at the place
to be tested.  If it returns t, fill commands do not break the line there.Ffill-find-break-point
Move point to a proper line breaking position of the current line.
Don't move back past the buffer position LIMIT.

This function is called when we are going to break the current line
after or before a non-ascii character.  If the charset of the
character has the property `fill-find-break-point-function', this
function calls the property value as a function with one arg LINEBEG.
If the charset has no such property, do nothing.Ffill-region-as-paragraph
Fill the region as one paragraph.
It removes any paragraph breaks in the region and extra newlines at the end,
indents and fills lines between the margins given by the
`current-left-margin' and `current-fill-column' functions.
(In most cases, the variable `fill-column' controls the width.)
It leaves point at the beginning of the line following the paragraph.

Normally performs justification according to the `current-justification'
function, but with a prefix arg, does full justification instead.

From a program, optional third arg JUSTIFY can specify any type of
justification.  Fourth arg NOSQUEEZE non-nil means not to make spaces
between words canonical before filling.  Fifth arg SQUEEZE-AFTER, if non-nil,
means don't canonicalize spaces before that position.

Return the fill-prefix used for filling.

If `sentence-end-double-space' is non-nil, then period followed by one
space does not end a sentence, so don't break a line there.Fskip-line-prefix
If point is inside the string PREFIX at the beginning of line, move past it.Ffill-paragraph
Fill paragraph at or after point.  Prefix ARG means justify as well.
If `sentence-end-double-space' is non-nil, then period followed by one
space does not end a sentence, so don't break a line there.
the variable `fill-column' controls the width for filling.

If `fill-paragraph-function' is non-nil, we call it (passing our
argument to it), and if it returns non-nil, we simply return its value.

If `fill-paragraph-function' is nil, return the `fill-prefix' used for filling.Ffill-region
Fill each of the paragraphs in the region.
A prefix arg means justify as well.
Ordinarily the variable `fill-column' controls the width.

Noninteractively, the third argument JUSTIFY specifies which
kind of justification to do: `full', `left', `right', `center',
or `none' (equivalent to nil).  t means handle each paragraph
as specified by its text properties.

The fourth arg NOSQUEEZE non-nil means to leave
whitespace other than line breaks untouched, and fifth arg TO-EOP
non-nil means to keep filling to the end of the paragraph (or next
hard newline, if `use-hard-newlines' is on).

Return the fill-prefix used for filling the last paragraph.

If `sentence-end-double-space' is non-nil, then period followed by one
space does not end a sentence, so don't break a line there.Vdefault-justification
*Method of justifying text not otherwise specified.
Possible values are `left', `right', `full', `center', or `none'.
The requested kind of justification is done whenever lines are filled.
The `justification' text-property  can locally override this variable.
This variable automatically becomes buffer-local when set in any fashion.Fcurrent-justification
How should we justify this line?
This returns the value of the text-property `justification',
or the variable `default-justification' if there is no text-property.
However, it returns nil rather than `none' to mean "don't justify".Fset-justification
Set the region's justification style.
The kind of justification to use is prompted for.
If the mark is not active, this command operates on the current paragraph.
If the mark is active, the region is used.  However, if the beginning and end
of the region are not at paragraph breaks, they are moved to the beginning and
end of the paragraphs they are in.
If `use-hard-newlines' is true, all hard newlines are taken to be paragraph
breaks.

When calling from a program, operates just on region between BEGIN and END,
unless optional fourth arg WHOLE-PAR is non-nil.  In that case bounds are
extended to include entire paragraphs as in the interactive command.Fset-justification-none
Disable automatic filling for paragraphs in the region.
If the mark is not active, this applies to the current paragraph.Fset-justification-left
Make paragraphs in the region left-justified.
This is usually the default, but see the variable `default-justification'.
If the mark is not active, this applies to the current paragraph.Fset-justification-right
Make paragraphs in the region right-justified:
Flush at the right margin and ragged on the left.
If the mark is not active, this applies to the current paragraph.Fset-justification-full
Make paragraphs in the region fully justified:
This makes lines flush on both margins by inserting spaces between words.
If the mark is not active, this applies to the current paragraph.Fset-justification-center
Make paragraphs in the region centered.
If the mark is not active, this applies to the current paragraph.Fjustify-current-line
Do some kind of justification on this line.
Normally does full justification: adds spaces to the line to make it end at
the column given by `current-fill-column'.
Optional first argument HOW specifies alternate type of justification:
it can be `left', `right', `full', `center', or `none'.  
If HOW is t, will justify however the `current-justification' function says to.
If HOW is nil or missing, full justification is done by default.
Second arg EOP non-nil means that this is the last line of the paragraph, so
it will not be stretched by full justification.
Third arg NOSQUEEZE non-nil means to leave interior whitespace unchanged,
otherwise it is made canonical.Funjustify-current-line
Remove justification whitespace from current line.
If the line is centered or right-justified, this function removes any
indentation past the left margin.  If the line is full-justified, it removes
extra spaces between words.  It does nothing in other justification modes.Funjustify-region
Remove justification whitespace from region.
For centered or right-justified regions, this function removes any indentation
past the left margin from each line.  For full-justified lines, it removes 
extra spaces between words.  It does nothing in other justification modes.
Arguments BEGIN and END are optional; default is the whole buffer.Ffill-nonuniform-paragraphs
Fill paragraphs within the region, allowing varying indentation within each.
This command divides the region into "paragraphs",
only at paragraph-separator lines, then fills each paragraph
using as the fill prefix the smallest indentation of any line
in the paragraph.

When calling from a program, pass range to fill as first two arguments.

Optional third and fourth arguments JUSTIFY and MAIL-FLAG:
JUSTIFY to justify paragraphs (prefix arg),
When filling a mail message, pass a regexp for CITATION-REGEXP
which will match the prefix of a line which is a citation marker
plus whitespace, but no other kind of prefix.
Also, if CITATION-REGEXP is non-nil,  don't fill header lines.Ffill-individual-paragraphs
Fill paragraphs of uniform indentation within the region.
This command divides the region into "paragraphs", 
treating every change in indentation level or prefix as a paragraph boundary,
then fills each paragraph using its indentation level as the fill prefix.

There is one special case where a change in indentation does not start
a new paragraph.  This is for text of this form:

   foo>    This line with extra indentation starts
   foo> a paragraph that continues on more lines.

These lines are filled together.

When calling from a program, pass the range to fill
as the first two arguments.

Optional third and fourth arguments JUSTIFY and MAIL-FLAG:
JUSTIFY to justify paragraphs (prefix arg),
When filling a mail message, pass a regexp for CITATION-REGEXP
which will match the prefix of a line which is a citation marker
plus whitespace, but no other kind of prefix.
Also, if CITATION-REGEXP is non-nil,  don't fill header lines.Fforward-page
Move forward to page boundary.  With arg, repeat, or go back if negative.
A page boundary is any line whose beginning matches the regexp
`page-delimiter'.Fbackward-page
Move backward to page boundary.  With arg, repeat, or go fwd if negative.
A page boundary is any line whose beginning matches the regexp
`page-delimiter'.Fmark-page
Put mark at end of page, point at beginning.
A numeric arg specifies to move forward or backward by that many pages,
thus marking a page other than the one point was originally in.Fnarrow-to-page
Make text outside current page invisible.
A numeric arg specifies to move forward or backward by that many pages,
thus showing a page other than the one point was originally in.Fcount-lines-page
Report number of lines on current page, and how many are before or after point.Fwhat-page
Print page and line number of point.Vuse-hard-newlines
Non-nil means to distinguish hard and soft newlines.
See also the documentation for the function `use-hard-newlines'.Fuse-hard-newlines
Minor mode to distinguish hard and soft newlines.
When active, the functions `newline' and `open-line' add the
text-property `hard' to newlines that they insert, and a line is
only considered as a candidate to match `paragraph-start' or
`paragraph-separate' if it follows a hard newline.

Prefix argument says to turn mode on if positive, off if negative.
When the mode is turned on, if there are newlines in the buffer but no hard
newlines, ask the user whether to mark as hard any newlines preceeding a 
`paragraph-start' line.  From a program, second arg INSERT specifies whether
to do this; it can be `never' to change nothing, t or `always' to force
marking, `guess' to try to do the right thing with no questions, nil 
or anything else to ask the user.

Newlines not marked hard are called "soft", and are always internal
to paragraphs.  The fill functions insert and delete only soft newlines.Vparagraph-start
*Regexp for beginning of a line that starts OR separates paragraphs.
This regexp should match lines that separate paragraphs
and should also match lines that start a paragraph
(and are part of that paragraph).

This is matched against the text at the left margin, which is not necessarily
the beginning of the line, so it should never use "^" as an anchor.  This
ensures that the paragraph functions will work equally well within a region
of text indented by a margin setting.

The variable `paragraph-separate' specifies how to distinguish
lines that start paragraphs from lines that separate them.

If the variable `use-hard-newlines' is non-nil, then only lines following a
hard newline are considered to match.Vparagraph-separate
*Regexp for beginning of a line that separates paragraphs.
If you change this, you may have to change `paragraph-start' also.

This is matched against the text at the left margin, which is not necessarily
the beginning of the line, so it should not use "^" as an anchor.  This
ensures that the paragraph functions will work equally within a region of
text indented by a margin setting.Vsentence-end
*Regexp describing the end of a sentence.
The value includes the whitespace following the sentence.
All paragraph boundaries also end sentences, regardless.

The default value specifies that in order to be recognized as the end
of a sentence, the ending period, question mark, or exclamation point
must be followed by two spaces, unless it's inside some sort of quotes
or parenthesis.

See also the variable `sentence-end-double-space', the variable
`sentence-end-without-period' and Info node `Sentences'.Vpage-delimiter
*Regexp describing line-beginnings that separate pages.Vparagraph-ignore-fill-prefix
*Non-nil means the paragraph commands are not affected by `fill-prefix'.
This is desirable in modes where blank lines are the paragraph delimiters.Fforward-paragraph
Move forward to end of paragraph.
With argument ARG, do it ARG times;
a negative argument ARG = -N means move backward N paragraphs.

A line which `paragraph-start' matches either separates paragraphs
(if `paragraph-separate' matches it also) or is the first line of a paragraph.
A paragraph end is the beginning of a line which is not part of the paragraph
to which the end of the previous line belongs, or the end of the buffer.Fbackward-paragraph
Move backward to start of paragraph.
With argument ARG, do it ARG times;
a negative argument ARG = -N means move forward N paragraphs.

A paragraph start is the beginning of a line which is a
`first-line-of-paragraph' or which is ordinary text and follows a
paragraph-separating line; except: if the first real line of a
paragraph is preceded by a blank line, the paragraph starts at that
blank line.

See `forward-paragraph' for more information.Fmark-paragraph
Put point at beginning of this paragraph, mark at end.
The paragraph marked is the one that contains point or follows point.Fkill-paragraph
Kill forward to end of paragraph.
With arg N, kill forward to Nth end of paragraph;
negative arg -N means kill backward to Nth start of paragraph.Fbackward-kill-paragraph
Kill back to start of paragraph.
With arg N, kill back to Nth start of paragraph;
negative arg -N means kill forward to Nth end of paragraph.Ftranspose-paragraphs
Interchange this (or next) paragraph with previous one.Fforward-sentence
Move forward to next `sentence-end'.  With argument, repeat.
With negative argument, move backward repeatedly to `sentence-beginning'.

The variable `sentence-end' is a regular expression that matches ends of
sentences.  Also, every paragraph boundary terminates sentences as well.Fbackward-sentence
Move backward to start of sentence.  With arg, do it arg times.
See `forward-sentence' for more information.Fkill-sentence
Kill from point to end of sentence.
With arg, repeat; negative arg -N means kill back to Nth start of sentence.Fbackward-kill-sentence
Kill back from point to start of sentence.
With arg, repeat, or kill forward to Nth end of sentence if negative arg -N.Fmark-end-of-sentence
Put mark at end of sentence.  Arg works as in `forward-sentence'.Ftranspose-sentences
Interchange this (next) and previous sentence.Vtext-mode-hook
Normal hook run when entering Text mode and many related modes.Vtext-mode-variant
Non-nil if this buffer's major mode is a variant of Text mode.Vtext-mode-syntax-table
Syntax table used while in text mode.Vtext-mode-abbrev-table
Abbrev table used while in text mode.Vtext-mode-map
Keymap for Text mode.
Many other modes, such as Mail mode, Outline mode and Indented Text mode,
inherit all the commands defined in this map.Ftext-mode
Major mode for editing text written for humans to read.
In this mode, paragraphs are delimited only by blank or white lines.
You can thus get the full benefit of adaptive filling
 (see the variable `adaptive-fill-mode').
\{text-mode-map}
Turning on Text mode runs the normal hook `text-mode-hook'.Fparagraph-indent-text-mode
Major mode for editing text, with leading spaces starting a paragraph.
In this mode, you do not need blank lines between paragraphs
when the first line of the following paragraph starts with whitespace.
`paragraph-indent-minor-mode' provides a similar facility as a minor mode.
Special commands:
\{text-mode-map}
Turning on Paragraph-Indent Text mode runs the normal hooks
`text-mode-hook' and `paragraph-indent-text-mode-hook'.Fparagraph-indent-minor-mode
Minor mode for editing text, with leading spaces starting a paragraph.
In this mode, you do not need blank lines between paragraphs when the
first line of the following paragraph starts with whitespace, as with
`paragraph-indent-mode'.
Turning on Paragraph-Indent minor mode runs the normal hook
`paragraph-indent-text-mode-hook'.Ftext-mode-hook-identify
Mark that this mode has run `text-mode-hook'.
This is how `toggle-text-mode-auto-fill' knows which buffers to operate on.Ftoggle-text-mode-auto-fill
Toggle whether to use Auto Fill in Text mode and related modes.
This command affects all buffers that use modes related to Text mode,
both existing buffers and buffers that you subsequently create.Fcenter-paragraph
Center each nonblank line in the paragraph at or after point.
See `center-line' for more info.Fcenter-region
Center each nonblank line starting in the region.
See `center-line' for more info.Fcenter-line
Center the line point is on, within the width specified by `fill-column'.
This means adjusting the indentation so that it equals
the distance between the end of the text and `fill-column'.
The argument NLINES says how many lines to center.Vvc-ignore-vc-files
Obsolete -- use `vc-handled-backends'.Vvc-master-templates
Obsolete -- use vc-BACKEND-master-templates.Vvc-header-alist
Obsolete -- use vc-BACKEND-header.Vvc-handled-backends
*List of version control backends for which VC will be used.
Entries in this list will be tried in order to determine whether a
file is under that sort of version control.
Removing an entry from the list prevents VC from being activated
when visiting a file managed by that backend.
An empty list disables VC altogether.Vvc-path
*List of extra directories to search for version control commands.Vvc-make-backup-files
*If non-nil, backups of registered files are made as with other files.
If nil (the default), files covered by version control don't get backups.Vvc-follow-symlinks
*What to do if visiting a symbolic link to a file under version control.
Editing such a file through the link bypasses the version control system,
which is dangerous and probably not what you want.

If this variable is t, VC follows the link and visits the real file,
telling you about it in the echo area.  If it is `ask', VC asks for
confirmation whether it should follow the link.  If nil, the link is
visited and a warning displayed.Vvc-display-status
*If non-nil, display revision number and lock status in modeline.
Otherwise, not displayed.Vvc-consult-headers
*If non-nil, identify work files by searching for version headers.Vvc-keep-workfiles
*If non-nil, don't delete working files after registering changes.
If the back-end is CVS, workfiles are always kept, regardless of the
value of this flag.Vvc-mistrust-permissions
*If non-nil, don't assume permissions/ownership track version-control status.
If nil, do rely on the permissions.
See also variable `vc-consult-headers'.Fvc-mistrust-permissions
Internal access function to variable `vc-mistrust-permissions' for FILE.Fvc-mode
Version Control minor mode.
This minor mode is automatically activated whenever you visit a file under
control of one of the revision control systems in `vc-handled-backends'.
VC commands are globally reachable under the prefix `\[vc-prefix-map]':
\{vc-prefix-map}Vvc-file-prop-obarray
Obarray for per-file properties.Fvc-file-setprop
Set per-file VC PROPERTY for FILE to VALUE.Fvc-file-getprop
Get per-file VC PROPERTY for FILE.Fvc-file-clearprops
Clear all VC properties of FILE.Fvc-make-backend-sym
Return BACKEND-specific version of VC symbol SYM.Fvc-find-backend-function
Return BACKEND-specific implementation of FUN.
If there is no such implementation, return the default implementation; 
if that doesn't exist either, return nil.Fvc-call-backend
Call for BACKEND the implementation of FUNCTION-NAME with the given ARGS.
Calls

    (apply 'vc-BACKEND-FUN ARGS)

if vc-BACKEND-FUN exists (after trying to find it in vc-BACKEND.el)
and else calls

    (apply 'vc-default-FUN BACKEND ARGS)

It is usually called via the `vc-call' macro.Fvc-parse-buffer
Find PATTERN in the current buffer and return its Ith submatch.Fvc-insert-file
Insert the contents of FILE into the current buffer.

Optional argument LIMIT is a regexp.  If present, the file is inserted
in chunks of size BLOCKSIZE (default 8 kByte), until the first
occurrence of LIMIT is found.  The function returns non-nil if FILE 
exists and its contents were successfully inserted.Fvc-registered
Return non-nil if FILE is registered in a version control system.

This function performs the check each time it is called.  To rely
on the result of a previous call, use `vc-backend' instead.  If the
file was previously registered under a certain backend, then that
backend is tried first.Fvc-backend
Return the version control type of FILE, nil if it is not registered.Fvc-backend-subdirectory-name
Return where the master and lock FILEs for the current directory are kept.Fvc-name
Return the master name of FILE.
If the file is not registered, or the master name is not known, return nil.Fvc-checkout-model
Indicate how FILE is checked out.

If FILE is not registered, this function always returns nil.
For registered files, the possible values are:

  'implicit   FILE is always writeable, and checked out `implicitly'
              when the user saves the first changes to the file.

  'locking    FILE is read-only if up-to-date; user must type
              \[vc-toggle-read-only] before editing.  Strict locking
              is assumed.

  'announce   FILE is read-only if up-to-date; user must type
              \[vc-toggle-read-only] before editing.  But other users
              may be editing at the same time.

If FILE is not registered, this function always returns nil.Fvc-user-login-name
Return the name under which the user is logged in, as a string.
(With optional argument UID, return the name of that user.)
This function does the same as function `user-login-name', but unlike
that, it never returns nil.  If a UID cannot be resolved, that
UID is returned as a string.Fvc-state
Return the version control state of FILE.

If FILE is not registered, this function always returns nil.
For registered files, the value returned is one of:

  'up-to-date        The working file is unmodified with respect to the
                     latest version on the current branch, and not locked.

  'edited            The working file has been edited by the user.  If
                     locking is used for the file, this state means that
                     the current version is locked by the calling user.

  USER               The current version of the working file is locked by
                     some other USER (a string).
            
  'needs-patch       The file has not been edited by the user, but there is
                     a more recent version on the current branch stored
                     in the master file.

  'needs-merge       The file has been edited by the user, and there is also
                     a more recent version on the current branch stored in
                     the master file.  This state can only occur if locking
                     is not used for the file.

  'unlocked-changes  The current version of the working file is not locked,
                     but the working file has been changed with respect
                     to that version.  This state can only occur for files
                     with locking; it represents an erroneous condition that
                     should be resolved by the user (vc-next-action will
                     prompt the user to do it).Fvc-up-to-date-p
Convenience function that checks whether `vc-state' of FILE is `up-to-date'.Fvc-default-state-heuristic
Default implementation of vc-state-heuristic.
It simply calls the real state computation function `vc-BACKEND-state'
and does not employ any heuristic at all.Fvc-workfile-version
Return the version level of the current workfile FILE.
If FILE is not registered, this function always returns nil.Fvc-default-registered
Check if FILE is registered in BACKEND using vc-BACKEND-master-templates.Fvc-check-master-templates
Return non-nil if there is a master corresponding to FILE.

TEMPLATES is a list of strings or functions.  If an element is a
string, it must be a control string as required by `format', with two
string placeholders, such as "%sRCS/%s,v".  The directory part of
FILE is substituted for the first placeholder, the basename of FILE
for the second.  If a file with the resulting name exists, it is taken
as the master of FILE, and returned.

If an element of TEMPLATES is a function, it is called with the
directory part and the basename of FILE as arguments.  It should
return non-nil if it finds a master; that value is then returned by
this function.Fvc-toggle-read-only
Change read-only status of current buffer, perhaps via version control.
If the buffer is visiting a file registered with version control,
then check the file in or out.  Otherwise, just change the read-only flag
of the buffer.
With prefix argument, ask for version number to check in or check out.
Check-out of a specified version number does not lock the file;
to do that, use this command a second time with no argument.Fvc-default-make-version-backups-p
Return non-nil if unmodified versions should be backed up locally.
The default is to switch off this feature.Fvc-version-backup-file-name
Return a backup file name for REV or the current version of FILE.
If MANUAL is non-nil it means that a name for backups created by
the user should be returned; if REGEXP is non-nil that means to return
a regexp for matching all such backup files, regardless of the version.Fvc-delete-automatic-version-backups
Delete all existing automatic version backups for FILE.Fvc-make-version-backup
Make a backup copy of FILE, which is assumed in sync with the repository.
Before doing that, check if there are any old backups and get rid of them.Fvc-before-save
Function to be called by `basic-save-buffer' (in files.el).Fvc-after-save
Function to be called by `basic-save-buffer' (in files.el).Fvc-mode-line
Set `vc-mode' to display type of version control for FILE.
The value is set in the current buffer, which should be the buffer
visiting FILE.Fvc-default-mode-line-string
Return string for placement in modeline by `vc-mode-line' for FILE.
Format:

  "BACKEND-REV"        if the file is up-to-date
  "BACKEND:REV"        if the file is edited (or locked by the calling user)
  "BACKEND:LOCKER:REV" if the file is locked by somebody else

This function assumes that the file is registered.Fvc-follow-link
If current buffer visits a symbolic link, visit the real file.
If the real file is already visited in another buffer, make that buffer
current, and kill the buffer that visits the link.Fvc-find-file-hook
Function for `find-file-hooks' activating VC mode if appropriate.Fvc-file-not-found-hook
When file is not found, try to check it out from version control.
Returns t if checkout was successful, nil otherwise.
Used in `find-file-not-found-hooks'.Fvc-kill-buffer-hook
Discard VC info about a file when we kill its buffer.Fdefine-widget
Define a new widget type named NAME from CLASS.

NAME and CLASS should both be symbols, CLASS should be one of the
existing widget types, or nil to create the widget from scratch.

After the new widget has been defined, the following two calls will
create identical widgets:

* (widget-create NAME)

* (apply 'widget-create CLASS ARGS)

The third argument DOC is a documentation string for the widget.Fone-window-p
Return non-nil if the selected window is the only window (in its frame).
Optional arg NOMINI non-nil means don't count the minibuffer
even if it is active.

The optional arg ALL-FRAMES t means count windows on all frames.
If it is `visible', count windows on all visible frames.
ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means count only the selected frame,
plus the minibuffer it uses (which may be on another frame).
If ALL-FRAMES is neither nil nor t, count only the selected frame.Fwalk-windows
Cycle through all visible windows, calling PROC for each one.
PROC is called with a window as argument.

Optional second arg MINIBUF t means count the minibuffer window even
if not active.  MINIBUF nil or omitted means count the minibuffer iff
it is active.  MINIBUF neither t nor nil means not to count the
minibuffer even if it is active.

Several frames may share a single minibuffer; if the minibuffer
counts, all windows on all frames that share that minibuffer count
too.  Therefore, if you are using a separate minibuffer frame
and the minibuffer is active and MINIBUF says it counts,
`walk-windows' includes the windows in the frame from which you
entered the minibuffer, as well as the minibuffer window.

ALL-FRAMES is the optional third argument.
ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means cycle within the frames as specified above.
ALL-FRAMES = `visible' means include windows on all visible frames.
ALL-FRAMES = 0 means include windows on all visible and iconified frames.
ALL-FRAMES = t means include windows on all frames including invisible frames.
If ALL-FRAMES is a frame, it means include windows on that frame.
Anything else means restrict to the selected frame.Fget-window-with-predicate
Return a window satisfying PREDICATE.

This function cycles through all visible windows using `walk-windows',
calling PREDICATE on each one.  PREDICATE is called with a window as
argument.  The first window for which PREDICATE returns a non-nil
value is returned.  If no window satisfies PREDICATE, DEFAULT is
returned.

Optional second arg MINIBUF t means count the minibuffer window even
if not active.  MINIBUF nil or omitted means count the minibuffer iff
it is active.  MINIBUF neither t nor nil means not to count the
minibuffer even if it is active.

Several frames may share a single minibuffer; if the minibuffer
counts, all windows on all frames that share that minibuffer count
too.  Therefore, if you are using a separate minibuffer frame
and the minibuffer is active and MINIBUF says it counts,
`walk-windows' includes the windows in the frame from which you
entered the minibuffer, as well as the minibuffer window.

ALL-FRAMES is the optional third argument.
ALL-FRAMES nil or omitted means cycle within the frames as specified above.
ALL-FRAMES = `visible' means include windows on all visible frames.
ALL-FRAMES = 0 means include windows on all visible and iconified frames.
ALL-FRAMES = t means include windows on all frames including invisible frames.
If ALL-FRAMES is a frame, it means include windows on that frame.
Anything else means restrict to the selected frame.Fminibuffer-window-active-p
Return t if WINDOW (a minibuffer window) is now active.Fsave-selected-window
Execute BODY, then select the window that was selected before BODY.
However, if that window has become dead, don't get an error,
just refrain from switching to it.Fcount-windows
Return the number of visible windows.
This counts the windows in the selected frame and (if the minibuffer is
to be counted) its minibuffer frame (if that's not the same frame).
The optional arg MINIBUF non-nil means count the minibuffer
even if it is inactive.Fwindow-safely-shrinkable-p
Non-nil if the WINDOW can be shrunk without shrinking other windows.
If WINDOW is nil or omitted, it defaults to the currently selected window.Fbalance-windows
Make all visible windows the same height (approximately).Vsplit-window-keep-point
*If non-nil, split windows keeps the original point in both children.
This is often more convenient for editing.
If nil, adjust point in each of the two windows to minimize redisplay.
This is convenient on slow terminals, but point can move strangely.Fsplit-window-vertically
Split current window into two windows, one above the other.
The uppermost window gets ARG lines and the other gets the rest.
Negative arg means select the size of the lowermost window instead.
With no argument, split equally or close to it.
Both windows display the same buffer now current.

If the variable `split-window-keep-point' is non-nil, both new windows
will get the same value of point as the current window.  This is often
more convenient for editing.

Otherwise, we chose window starts so as to minimize the amount of
redisplay; this is convenient on slow terminals.  The new selected
window is the one that the current value of point appears in.  The
value of point can change if the text around point is hidden by the
new mode line.Fsplit-window-horizontally
Split current window into two windows side by side.
This window becomes the leftmost of the two, and gets ARG columns.
Negative arg means select the size of the rightmost window instead.
The argument includes the width of the window's scroll bar; if there
are no scroll bars, it includes the width of the divider column
to the window's right, if any.  No arg means split equally.Fset-window-text-height
Sets the height in lines of the text display area of WINDOW to HEIGHT.
This doesn't include the mode-line (or header-line if any) or any
partial-height lines in the text display area.

If WINDOW is nil, the selected window is used.

Note that the current implementation of this function cannot always set
the height exactly, but attempts to be conservative, by allocating more
lines than are actually needed in the case where some error may be present.Fenlarge-window-horizontally
Make current window ARG columns wider.Fshrink-window-horizontally
Make current window ARG columns narrower.Fwindow-buffer-height
Return the height (in screen lines) of the buffer that WINDOW is displaying.Fcount-screen-lines
Return the number of screen lines in the region.
The number of screen lines may be different from the number of actual lines,
due to line breaking, display table, etc.

Optional arguments BEG and END default to `point-min' and `point-max'
respectively.

If region ends with a newline, ignore it unless optional third argument
COUNT-FINAL-NEWLINE is non-nil.

The optional fourth argument WINDOW specifies the window used for obtaining
parameters such as width, horizontal scrolling, and so on.  The default is
to use the selected window's parameters.

Like `vertical-motion', `count-screen-lines' always uses the current buffer,
regardless of which buffer is displayed in WINDOW.  This makes possible to use
`count-screen-lines' in any buffer, whether or not it is currently displayed
in some window.Ffit-window-to-buffer
Make WINDOW the right size to display its contents exactly.
If WINDOW is omitted or nil, it defaults to the selected window.
If the optional argument MAX-HEIGHT is supplied, it is the maximum height
  the window is allowed to be, defaulting to the frame height.
If the optional argument MIN-HEIGHT is supplied, it is the minimum
  height the window is allowed to be, defaulting to `window-min-height'.

The heights in MAX-HEIGHT and MIN-HEIGHT include the mode-line and/or
header-line.Fshrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer
Shrink the WINDOW to be as small as possible to display its contents.
If WINDOW is omitted or nil, it defaults to the selected window.
Do not shrink to less than `window-min-height' lines.
Do nothing if the buffer contains more lines than the present window height,
or if some of the window's contents are scrolled out of view,
or if shrinking this window would also shrink another window.
or if the window is the only window of its frame.
Return non-nil if the window was shrunk.Fkill-buffer-and-window
Kill the current buffer and delete the selected window.Fquit-window
Quit the current buffer.  Bury it, and maybe delete the selected frame.
(The frame is deleted if it is contains a dedicated window for the buffer.)
With a prefix argument, kill the buffer instead.

Noninteractively, if KILL is non-nil, then kill the current buffer,
otherwise bury it.

If WINDOW is non-nil, it specifies a window; we delete that window,
and the buffer that is killed or buried is the one in that window.Vemacs-version
Version numbers of this version of Emacs.Vemacs-build-time
Time at which Emacs was dumped out.Femacs-version
Return string describing the version of Emacs that is running.
If optional argument HERE is non-nil, insert string at point.
Don't use this function in programs to choose actions according
to the system configuration; look at `system-configuration' instead.
