  "Eshell is a command shell implemented entirely in Emacs Lisp.  It
invokes no external processes beyond those requested by the user.  It
is intended to be a functional replacement for command shells such as
bash, zsh, rc, 4dos; since Emacs itself is capable of handling most of
the tasks accomplished by such tools."

;;; Commentary:

;;;_* What does Eshell offer you?
;;
;; Despite the sheer fact that running an Emacs shell can be fun, here
;; are a few of the unique features offered by Eshell:
;;
;; @ Integration with the Emacs Lisp programming environment
;;
;; @ A high degree of configurability
;;
;; @ The ability to have the same shell on every system Emacs has been
;;   ported to. Since Eshell imposes no external requirements, and
;;   relies upon only the Lisp functions exposed by Emacs, it is quite
;;   operating system independent. Several of the common UNIX
;;   commands, such as ls, mv, rm, ln, etc., have been implemented in
;;   Lisp in order to provide a more consistent work environment.
;;
;; For those who might be using an older version of Eshell, version
;; 2.1 represents an entirely new, module-based architecture. It
;; supports most of the features offered by modern shells. Here is a
;; brief list of some of its more visible features:
;;
;; @ Command argument completion (tcsh, zsh)
;; @ Input history management (bash)
;; @ Intelligent output scrolling
;; @ Psuedo-devices (such as "/dev/clip" for copying to the clipboard)
;; @ Extended globbing (zsh)
;; @ Argument and globbing predication (zsh)
;; @ I/O redirection to buffers, files, symbols, processes, etc.
;; @ Many niceties otherwise seen only in 4DOS
;; @ Alias functions, both Lisp and Eshell-syntax
;; @ Piping, sequenced commands, background jobs, etc...

;;
;;;_* How to begin
;;
;; To start using Eshell, add the following to your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (load "eshell-auto")
;;
;; This will define all of the necessary autoloads.
;;
;; Now type `M-x eshell'.  See the INSTALL file for full installation
;; instructions.
;;
;;;_* Philosophy
;;
;; A shell is a layer which metaphorically surrounds the kernel, or
;; heart of an operating system.  This kernel can be seen as an engine
;; of pure functionality, waiting to serve, while the user programs
;; take advantage of that functionality to accomplish their purpose.
;;
;; The shell's role is to make that functionality accessible to the
;; user in an unformed state.  Very roughly, it associates kernel
;; functionality with textual commands, allowing the user to interact
;; with the operating system via linguistic constructs.  Process
;; invocation is perhaps the most significant form this takes, using
;; the kernel's `fork' and `exec' functions.
;;
;; Other programs also interact with the functionality of the kernel,
;; but these user applications typically offer a specific range of
;; functionality, and thus are not classed as "shells" proper.
;; (What they lose in quiddity, they gain in rigidity).
;;
;; Emacs is also a user application, but it does make the
;; functionality of the kernel accessible through an interpreted
;; language -- namely, Lisp.  For that reason, there is little
;; preventing Emacs from serving the same role as a modern shell.  It
;; too can manipulate the kernel in an unpredetermined way to cause
;; system changes.  All it's missing is the shell-ish linguistic
;; model.
;;
;; Enter Eshell.  Eshell translates "shell-like" syntax into Lisp
;; in order to exercise the kernel in the same manner as typical
;; system shells.  There is a fundamental difference here, however,
;; although it may seem subtle at first...
;;
;; Shells like csh and Bourne shell were written several decades ago,
;; in different times, under more restrictive circumstances.  This
;; confined perspective shows itself in the paradigm used by nearly
;; all command-line shells since.  They are linear in conception, byte
;; stream-based, sequential, and confined to movement within a single
;; host machine.
;;
;; Emacs, on the other hand, is more than just a limited translator
;; that can invoke subprocesses and redirect file handles.  It also
;; manages character buffers, windowing frames, network connections,
;; registers, bookmarks, processes, etc.  In other words, it's a very
;; multi-dimensional environment, within which eshell emulates a highly
;; linear methodology.
;;
;; Taking a moment, let's look at how this could affect the future of
;; a shell allowed to develop in such a wider field of play:
;;
;; @ There is no reason why directory movement should be linear, and
;;   confined to a single file-system.  Emacs, through w3 and ange-ftp,
;;   has access to the entire Web.  Why not allow a user to cd to
;;   multiple directories simultaneously, for example?  It might make
;;   some tasks easier, such as diff'ing files separated by very long
;;   pathnames.
;;
;; @ Data sources are available from anywhere Emacs can derive
;;   information from: not just from files or the output of other
;;   processes.
;;
;; @ Multiple shell invocations all share the same environment -- even
;;   the same process list!  It would be possible to have "process
;;   views", so that one buffer is watching standard output, another
;;   standard error, and another the result of standard output grep'd
;;   through a regular expression...
;;
;; @ It is not necessary to "leave" the shell, losing all input and
;;   output history, environment variables, directory stack, etc.
;;   Emacs could save the contents of your eshell environment, and
;;   restore all of it (or at least as much as possible) each time you
;;   restart.  This could occur automatically, without requiring
;;   complex initialization scripts.
;;
;; @ Typos occur all of the time; many of them are repeats of common
;;   errors, such as 'dri' for `dir'.  Since executing non-existent
;;   programs is rarely the intention of the user, eshell could prompt
;;   for the replacement string, and then record that in a database of
;;   known misspellings. (Note: The typo at the beginning of this
;;   paragraph wasn't discovered until two months after I wrote the
;;   text; it was not intentional).
;;
;; @ Emacs' register and bookmarking facilities can be used for
;;   remembering where you've been, and what you've seen -- to varying
;;   levels of persistence.  They could perhaps even be tied to
;;   specific "moments" during eshell execution, which would include
;;   the environment at that time, as well as other variables.
;;   Although this would require functionality orthogonal to Emacs'
;;   own bookmarking facilities, the interface used could be made to
;;   operate very similarly.
;;
;; This presents a brief idea of what the fuller dimensionality of an
;; Emacs shell could offer.  It's not just the language of a shell
;; that determines how it's used, but also the Weltanschauung
;; underlying its design -- and which is felt behind even the smallest
;; feature.  I would hope the freedom provided by using Emacs as a
;; parent environment will invite rich ideas from others.  It
;; certainly feels as though all I've done so far is to tie down the
;; horse, so to speak, so that he will run at a man's pace.
;;
;;;_* Influences
;;
;; The author of Eshell has been a long-time user of the following
;; shells, all of which contributed to Eshell's design:
;;
;; @ rc
;; @ bash
;; @ zsh
;; @ sh
;; @ 4nt
;; @ csh

;;;_* Speeding up load time
;;
;; If you find that Eshell loads too slowly, there is something you
;; can do to speed it up.
;;
;; Create a file, named /tmp/elc, containing this filelist:
;;
;;   esh-util.elc
;;   eshell.elc
;;   esh-module.elc
;;   esh-var.elc
;;   esh-proc.elc
;;   esh-arg.elc
;;   esh-io.elc
;;   esh-ext.elc
;;   esh-cmd.elc
;;   esh-mode.elc
;;   esh-opt.elc
;;   em-alias.elc
;;   em-banner.elc
;;   em-basic.elc
;;   em-cmpl.elc
;;   em-dirs.elc
;;   em-pred.elc
;;   em-glob.elc
;;   em-hist.elc
;;   em-ls.elc
;;   em-prompt.elc
;;   em-rebind.elc
;;   em-script.elc
;;   em-smart.elc
;;   em-term.elc
;;   em-unix.elc
;;   em-xtra.elc
;;
;; The order is very important.  Remove from the filelist any features
;; you don't use.  These all begin with "em-".  If you don't use
;; Eshell's key rebinding module, you can remove "em-rebind.elc" from
;; the filelist.  The modules you are currently using are listed in
;; `eshell-modules-list'.
;;
;; Now, concatenating all of the above mentioned .elc files, in that
;; order, to another file.  Here is how to do this on UNIX:
;;
;;   cat `cat /tmp/elc` > tmp.elc ; mv tmp.elc eshell.elc
;;
;; Now your eshell.elc file contains all of the .elc files that make
;; up Eshell, in the right load order.  When you next load Eshell, it
;; will only have to read in this one file, which will greatly speed
;; things up.

;;;_* User Options
