used to manage the UNIX emulation portion of the Cygwin environment.
While many of these reflect their UNIX counterparts, each was written
specifically for Cygwin.  You may use the long or short option names 
interchangeably; for example, <tt class="literal">--help</tt> and 
<tt class="literal">-h</tt> function identically. All of the Cygwin 
command-line utilities support the <tt class="literal">--help</tt> and

Usage: cygcheck PROGRAM [ -v ] [ -h ]
       cygcheck -c [ PACKAGE ... ] [ -d ]
       cygcheck -s [ -r ] [ -v ] [ -h ]
       cygcheck -k
       cygcheck -f FILE [ FILE ... ]
       cygcheck -l [ PACKAGE ... ]
       cygcheck -p REGEXP
List system information, check installed packages, or query package database.

At least one command option or a PROGRAM is required, as shown above.

  PROGRAM              list library (DLL) dependencies of PROGRAM
  -c, --check-setup    show installed version of PACKAGE and verify integrity
                       (or for all installed packages if none specified)
  -d, --dump-only      just list packages, do not verify (with -c)
  -s, --sysinfo        produce diagnostic system information (implies -c -d)
  -r, --registry       also scan registry for Cygwin settings (with -s)
  -k, --keycheck       perform a keyboard check session (must be run from a
                       plain console only, not from a pty/rxvt/xterm)
  -f, --find-package   find the package that FILE belongs to
  -l, --list-package   list contents of PACKAGE (or all packages if none given)
  -p, --package-query  search for REGEXP in the entire cygwin.com package
                       repository (requies internet connectivity)
  -v, --verbose        produce more verbose output
  -h, --help           annotate output with explanatory comments when given
                       with another command, otherwise print this help
  -V, --version        print the version of cygcheck and exit

Note: -c, -f, and -l only report on packages that are currently installed. To
  search all official Cygwin packages use -p instead.  The -p REGEXP matches
  package names, descriptions, and names of files/paths within all packages.
</pre><p>
The <b class="command">cygcheck</b> program is a diagnostic utility for
dealing with Cygwin programs. If you are familiar with
<b class="command">dpkg</b> or <b class="command">rpm</b>,
<b class="command">cygcheck</b> is similar in many ways. (The major difference
is that <b class="command">setup.exe</b> handles installing and uninstalling
packages; see <a href="setup-net.html#internet-setup" title="Internet Setup">the section called &#8220;Internet Setup&#8221;</a> for more information.)
</p><p>
The <tt class="literal">-c</tt> option checks the version and status of 
installed Cygwin packages. If you specify one or more package names,
<b class="command">cygcheck</b> will limit its output to those packages,
or with no arguments it lists all packages. A package will be marked
<tt class="literal">Incomplete</tt> if files originally installed are no longer
present. The best thing to do in that situation is reinstall the package
with <b class="command">setup.exe</b>. To see which files are missing, use the
<tt class="literal">-v</tt> option. If you do not need to know the status
of each package and want <b class="command">cygcheck</b> to run faster, add the
<tt class="literal">-d</tt> option and <b class="command">cygcheck</b> will only
output the name and version for each package.
</p><p>
If you list one or more programs on the command line,
<b class="command">cygcheck</b> will diagnose the runtime environment of that
program or programs, providing the names of DLL files on which the program
depends.  If you specify the <tt class="literal">-s</tt> option,
<b class="command">cygcheck</b> will give general system information.  If you
list one or more programs on the command line and specify
<tt class="literal">-s</tt>, <b class="command">cygcheck</b> will report on
both.</p><p>
The <tt class="literal">-f</tt> option helps you to track down which package a
file came from, and <tt class="literal">-l</tt> lists all files in a package.
For example, to find out about <tt class="filename">/usr/bin/less</tt> and its
package:
</p><div class="example"><a name="id4731574"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 3.3. Example cygcheck usage</b></p><pre class="screen">
$ cygcheck -f /usr/bin/less
less-381-1

$ cygcheck -l less
/usr/bin/less.exe
/usr/bin/lessecho.exe
/usr/bin/lesskey.exe
/usr/man/man1/less.1
/usr/man/man1/lesskey.1
</pre></div><p>
</p><p>The <tt class="literal">-h</tt> option prints additional helpful
messages in the report, at the beginning of each section.  It also
adds table column headings.  While this is useful information, it also
adds some to the size of the report, so if you want a compact report
or if you know what everything is already, just leave this out.</p><p>The <tt class="literal">-v</tt> option causes the output to be more
verbose.  What this means is that additional information will be
reported which is usually not interesting, such as the internal
version numbers of DLLs, additional information about recursive DLL
usage, and if a file in one directory in the PATH also occurs in other
directories on the PATH.  </p><p>The <tt class="literal">-r</tt> option causes
<b class="command">cygcheck</b> to search your registry for information
that is relevent to Cygwin programs.  These registry entries are the
ones that have "Cygwin" in the name.  If you are paranoid about
privacy, you may remove information from this report, but please keep
in mind that doing so makes it harder to diagnose your problems.</p><p>In contrast to the other options that search the packages that are
installed on your local system, the <tt class="literal">-p</tt> option can be used
to search the entire official Cygwin package repository.  It takes as argument
a Perl-compatible regular expression which is used to match package names, 
package descriptions, and path/filenames of the contents of packages.  This
feature requires an active internet connection, since it must query the
<tt class="literal">cygwin.com</tt> web site.  In fact, it is equalivant to the
search that is available on the <a href="http://cygwin.com/packages/" target="_top">Cygwin
package listing</a> page.</p><p>For example, perhaps you are getting an error because you are missing a
certain DLL and you want to know which package includes that file:
</p><div class="example"><a name="id4731678"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 3.4. Searching all packages for a file</b></p><pre class="screen">
$ cygcheck -p 'cygintl-2\.dll'

coreutils-5.3.0-6         GNU core utilities (includes fileutils, sh-utils and textutils)
</pre></div><p>
</p><p>Note that this option takes a regular expression, not a glob or wildcard.
This means that you need to use <tt class="literal">.*</tt> if you want something
similar to the wildcard <tt class="literal">*</tt> commonly used in filename globbing.
Similarly, to match the period character you should use <tt class="literal">\.</tt>
since the <tt class="literal">.</tt> character in a regexp is a metacharacter that
will match any character.  Also be aware that the characters such as 
<tt class="literal">\</tt> and <tt class="literal">*</tt> are shell metacharacters, so 
they must be either escaped or quoted, as in the example above.</p><p>The third example above illustrates that if you want to match a whole 
filename, you should include the <tt class="literal">/</tt> path seperator.  In the
given example this ensures that filenames that happen to end in
<tt class="literal">ls.exe</tt> such as <tt class="literal">ncftpls.exe</tt> are not shown.
Note that this use does not mean "look for packages with <tt class="literal">ls</tt>
in the root directory," since the <tt class="literal">/</tt> can match anywhere in the
path.  It's just there to anchor the match so that it matches a full
filename.</p><p>By default the matching is case-sensitive.  To get a case insensitive
match, begin your regexp with <tt class="literal">(?i)</tt> which is a PCRE-specific
feature.  For complete documentation on Perl-compatible regular expression
syntax and options, read the <b class="command">perlre</b> manpage, or one of many
websites such as <tt class="literal">perldoc.com</tt> that document the Perl
language.</p><p>The <b class="command">cygcheck</b> program should be used to send
information about your system for troubleshooting when requested.  
When asked to run this command save the output so that you can email it,
for example:</p><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>The <b class="command">cygpath</b> program is a utility that
converts Windows native filenames to Cygwin POSIX-style pathnames and
vice versa.  It can be used when a Cygwin program needs to pass a file 
name to a native Windows program, or expects to get a file name from a
native Windows program.  Alternatively, <b class="command">cygpath</b> can 
output information about the location of important system directories 
in either format.  
</p><p>The <tt class="literal">-u</tt> and <tt class="literal">-w</tt> options
indicate whether you want a conversion to UNIX (POSIX) format 
(<tt class="literal">-u</tt>) or to Windows format (<tt class="literal">-w</tt>).  
Use the <tt class="literal">-d</tt> to get DOS-style (8.3) file and path names.
The <tt class="literal">-m</tt> option will output Windows-style format
but with forward slashes instead of backslashes.  This option is 
especially useful in shell scripts, which use backslashes as an escape 
character.</p><p> In combination with the <tt class="literal">-w</tt> option, you can use
the <tt class="literal">-l</tt> and <tt class="literal">-s</tt> options to use normal
(long) or DOS-style (short) form. The <tt class="literal">-d</tt> option is 
identical to <tt class="literal">-w</tt> and <tt class="literal">-s</tt> together.
</p><p>Caveat: The <tt class="literal">-l</tt> option does not work if the
<span class="emphasis"><em>check_case</em></span> parameter of <span class="emphasis"><em>CYGWIN</em></span> 
is set to <span class="emphasis"><em>strict</em></span>, since Cygwin is not able to match 
any Windows short path in this mode.
</p><p>The <tt class="literal">-p</tt> option means that you want to convert
a path-style string rather than a single filename.  For example, the
PATH environment variable is semicolon-delimited in Windows, but
colon-delimited in UNIX.  By giving <tt class="literal">-p</tt> you are
instructing <b class="command">cygpath</b> to convert between these
formats.</p><p>The <tt class="literal">-i</tt> option supresses the print out of the
usage message if no filename argument was given.  It can be used in
make file rules converting variables that may be omitted
to a proper format.  Note that <b class="command">cygpath</b> output may 
contain spaces (C:\Program Files) so should be enclosed in quotes.

<tt class="literal">-D</tt>, <tt class="literal">-H</tt>, <tt class="literal">-P</tt>, 
<tt class="literal">-S</tt>, and <tt class="literal">-W</tt> output directories used 
by Windows that are not the same on all systems, for example 
<tt class="literal">-S</tt> might output C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32 or C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM. 
The <tt class="literal">-H</tt> shows the Windows profiles directory that can 
be used as root of home.  The <tt class="literal">-A</tt> option forces use of 
the "All Users" directories instead of the current user for the 
<tt class="literal">-D</tt> and <tt class="literal">-P</tt> options. 
On Win9x systems with only a single user, <tt class="literal">-A</tt> has no
effect; <tt class="literal">-D</tt> and <tt class="literal">-AD</tt> would have the
same output.  By default the output is in UNIX (POSIX) format;

</pre><p>The <b class="command">dumper</b> utility can be used to create a
core dump of running Windows process. This core dump can be later loaded
to <b class="command">gdb</b> and analyzed. One common way to use 
<b class="command">dumper</b> is to plug it into cygwin's Just-In-Time 
debugging facility by adding

</p><pre class="screen">
error_start=x:\path\to\dumper.exe
</pre><p>

to the <span class="emphasis"><em>CYGWIN</em></span> environment variable. Please note that
<tt class="literal">x:\path\to\dumper.exe</tt> is Windows-style and not cygwin
path. If <tt class="literal">error_start</tt> is set this way, then dumper will
be started whenever some program encounters a fatal error.
</p><p>
<b class="command">dumper</b> can be also be started from the command line to 
create a core dump of any running process. Unfortunately, because of a Windows 
API limitation, when a core dump is created and <b class="command">dumper</b> 
exits, the target process is terminated too.
</p><p>
To save space in the core dump, <b class="command">dumper</b> doesn't write those
portions of target process' memory space that are loaded from executable and
dll files and are unchangeable, such as program code and debug info. Instead,
<b class="command">dumper</b> saves paths to files which contain that data. When a
core dump is loaded into gdb, it uses these paths to load appropriate files.
That means that if you create a core dump on one machine and try to debug it on
another, you'll need to place identical copies of the executable and dlls in 
the same directories as on the machine where the core dump was created.

the time for <b class="command">mkgroup</b> to run in a large domain.
Having gr_mem fields is helpful when a domain user logs in remotely

Its use is essential on the NT series (Windows NT, 2000, and XP) to

The <tt class="literal">-o</tt> option allows for special cases
(such as multiple domains) where the UIDs might match otherwise.
The <tt class="literal">-g</tt> option creates a local
user that corresponds to each local group. This is because NT assigns groups
file ownership.  The <tt class="literal">-m</tt> option bypasses the current
mount table so that, for example, two users who have a Windows home 
directory of H: could mount them differently.  The <tt class="literal">-s</tt>

SIDs, see <a href="ntsec.html" title="NT security and usage of ntsec">the section called &#8220;NT security and usage of ntsec&#8221;</a> in the Cygwin User's Guide.  The
<tt class="literal">-p</tt> option causes <b class="command">mkpasswd</b> to
use the specified prefix instead of the account home dir or <tt class="literal">/home/

would put local users' home directories in the Windows 'Profiles' directory. 
On Win9x machines the <tt class="literal">-u</tt> option creates an entry for

<tt class="filename">/d</tt>.  Note that in this case, the root mount is a
system-wide mount point that is visible to all users running Cygwin
programs, whereas the <tt class="filename">/d</tt> mount is only visible
to the current user.</p><p>The <b class="command">mount</b> utility is also the mechanism for
adding new mounts to the mount table.  The following example
demonstrates how to mount the directory
<tt class="filename">\\pollux\home\joe\data</tt> to <tt class="filename">/data</tt>.
</p><div class="example"><a name="id4733247"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 3.11. Adding mount points</b></p><pre class="screen">

</pre></div><p>Note that <b class="command">mount</b> was invoked from the Windows
command shell in the previous example.  In many Unix shells, including
bash, it is legal and convenient to use the forward "/" in Win32
pathnames since the "\" is the shell's escape character. </p><p>The <tt class="literal">-s</tt> flag to <b class="command">mount</b> is used to add a mount
in the system-wide mount table used by all Cygwin users on the system,
instead of the user-specific one.  System-wide mounts are displayed
by <b class="command">mount</b> as being of the "system" type, as is the
case for the <tt class="filename">/</tt> partition in the last example.
Under Windows NT, only those users with Administrator priviledges are
permitted to modify the system-wide mount table.</p><p>Note that a given POSIX path may only exist once in the user
table and once in the global, system-wide table.  Attempts to replace
the mount will fail with a busy error.  The <tt class="literal">-f</tt> (force) flag causes
the old mount to be silently replaced with the new one.  It will also
silence warnings about the non-existence of directories at the Win32
path location.</p><p>The <tt class="literal">-b</tt> flag is used to instruct Cygwin to treat binary and
text files in the same manner by default.  Binary mode mounts are
marked as "binmode" in the Flags column of <b class="command">mount</b>
output.  By default, mounts are in text mode ("textmode" in the Flags
column).</p><p>Normally, files ending in certain extensions (.exe, .com, .bat, .cmd) 
are assumed to be executable.  Files whose first two characters begin with 
'#!' are also considered to be executable.  
The <tt class="literal">-x</tt> flag is used to instruct Cygwin that the 
mounted file is "executable".  If the <tt class="literal">-x</tt> flag is used 
with a directory then all files in the directory are executable.  
This option allows other files to be marked as executable and avoids the 
overhead of opening each file to check for a '#!'.  The <tt class="literal">-X</tt>
option is very similar to <tt class="literal">-x</tt>, but also prevents Cygwin
from setting up commands and environment variables for a normal Windows 
program, adding another small performance gain.  The opposite of these 
flags is the <tt class="literal">-E</tt> flag, which means that no files should be 
marked as executable.  </p><p>
The <tt class="literal">-m</tt> option causes the <b class="command">mount</b> utility
to output a series of commands that could recreate both user and system mount 
points. You can save this output as a backup when experimenting with the
mount table. It also makes moving your settings to a different machine
much easier.
</p><p>
The <tt class="literal">-o</tt> option is the method via which various options about
the mount point may be recorded.  The following options are available (note that
most of the options are duplicates of other mount flags):</p><pre class="screen">
  user       - mount lives user-specific mount
  system     - mount lives in system table (default)
  binary     - files default to binary mode (default)
  text       - files default to CRLF text mode line endings
  exec       - files below mount point are all executable
  notexec    - files below mount point are not executable
  cygexec    - files below mount point are all cygwin executables
  nosuid     - no suid files are allowed (currently unimplemented)
  managed    - directory is managed by cygwin.  Mixed case and special

</pre></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id4733473"></a>Cygdrive mount points</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>Whenever Cygwin cannot use any of the existing mounts to convert
from a particular Win32 path to a POSIX one, Cygwin will, instead,
convert to a POSIX path using a default mount point:
<tt class="filename">/cygdrive</tt>.  For example, if Cygwin accesses
<tt class="filename">z:\foo</tt> and the z drive is not currently in the
mount table, then <tt class="filename">z:\</tt> will be accessible as
<tt class="filename">/cygdrive/z</tt>.  The <b class="command">mount</b> utility 
can be used to change this default automount prefix through the use of the
"--change-cygdrive-prefix" option.  In the following example, we will
set the automount prefix to <tt class="filename">/</tt>:</p><div class="example"><a name="id4733524"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 3.12. Changing the default prefix</b></p><pre class="screen">
<tt class="prompt">c:\cygwin\&gt;</tt> <b class="userinput"><tt>mount --change-cygdrive-prefix /</tt></b>
</pre></div><p>Note that the cygdrive prefix can be set both per-user and system-wide, 
and that as with all mounts, a user-specific mount takes precedence over the 
system-wide setting.  The <b class="command">mount</b> utility creates system-wide 
mounts by default if you do not specify a type.  Use the <tt class="literal">-s</tt> 
or <tt class="literal">-u</tt> flag to indicate a system or user mount, respectively.
You can always see the user and system cygdrive prefixes with the 
<tt class="literal">-p</tt> option.  Using the <tt class="literal">-b</tt>
flag with <tt class="literal">--change-cygdrive-prefix</tt> makes all new 
automounted filesystems default to binary mode file accesses.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id4733596"></a>Limitations</h4></div></div><div></div></div><p>Limitations: there is a hard-coded limit of 30 mount
points.  Also, although you can mount to pathnames that do not start
with "/", there is no way to make use of such mount points.</p><p>Normally the POSIX mount point in Cygwin is an existing empty
directory, as in standard UNIX. If this is the case, or if there is a
place-holder for the mount point (such as a file, a symbolic link
pointing anywhere, or a non-empty directory), you will get the expected
behavior. Files present in a mount point directory before the mount
become invisible to Cygwin programs.
</p><p>It is sometimes desirable to mount to a non-existent directory,
for example to avoid cluttering the root directory with names
such as
<tt class="filename">a</tt>, <tt class="filename">b</tt>, <tt class="filename">c</tt>
pointing to disks.
Although <b class="command">mount</b> will give you a warning, most
everything will work properly when you refer to the mount point
explicitly.  Some strange effects can occur however.
For example if your current working directory is
<tt class="filename">/dir</tt>,
say, and <tt class="filename">/dir/mtpt</tt> is a mount point, then
<tt class="filename">mtpt</tt> will not show up in an <b class="command">ls</b>
or
<b class="command">echo *</b> command and <b class="command">find .</b> will
not
find <tt class="filename">mtpt</tt>.

A normal user may only change the password for their own account,
but administrators may change passwords on any account.
<b class="command">passwd</b> also changes account information, such as
password expiry dates and intervals.</p><p>For password changes, the user is first prompted for their old
password, if one is present.  This password is then encrypted and
compared against the stored password.  The user has only one chance to
enter the correct password.  The administrators are permitted to

<b class="command">passwd</b> will prompt twice for this replacement and 
compare the second entry against the first.  Both entries are required to 
match in order for the password to be changed.</p><p>After the password has been entered, password aging information
is checked to see if the user is permitted to change their password
at this time.  If not, <b class="command">passwd</b> refuses to change the

and unlocked with the <tt class="literal">-u</tt> flag.  Similarly,
<tt class="literal">-c</tt> disables a user's ability to change passwords, and
<tt class="literal">-C</tt> allows a user to change passwords.  For password
expiry, the <tt class="literal">-e</tt> option disables expiration, while the
<tt class="literal">-E</tt> option causes the password to expire according to
the system's normal aging rules.  Use <tt class="literal">-p</tt> to disable
the password requirement for a user, or <tt class="literal">-P</tt> to require
a password.
</p><p>Administrators can also use <b class="command">passwd</b> to change
system-wide password expiry and length requirements with the
<tt class="literal">-i</tt>, <tt class="literal">-n</tt>, <tt class="literal">-x</tt>,

for a number of days.  After a user account has had an expired password
for <span class="emphasis"><em>NUM</em></span> days, the user may no longer sign on to
the account.  The <tt class="literal">-n</tt> option is
used to set the minimum number of days before a password may be changed.
The user will not be permitted to change the password until
<span class="emphasis"><em>MINDAYS</em></span> days have elapsed.  The
<tt class="literal">-x</tt> option is used to set the maximum number of days
a password remains valid.  After <span class="emphasis"><em>MAXDAYS</em></span> days, the
password is required to be changed.  Allowed values for the above options

identical. The <tt class="literal">-f</tt> option outputs a "full" listing with
usernames for UIDs. The <tt class="literal">-l</tt> option is the default display
mode, showing a "long" listing with all the above columns. The other display
option is <tt class="literal">-s</tt>, which outputs a shorter listing of just
PID, TTY, STIME, and COMMAND. The <tt class="literal">-u</tt> option allows you
to show only processes owned by a specific user. The <tt class="literal">-p</tt>
option allows you to show information for only the process with the
specified PID. The <tt class="literal">-W</tt>
option causes <b class="command">ps</b> show non-Cygwin Windows processes as 
well as Cygwin processes. The WINPID is also the PID, and they can be killed
with the Cygwin <b class="command">kill</b> command's <tt class="literal">-f</tt>

</pre><p>The <b class="command">regtool</b> program allows shell scripts
to access and modify the Windows registry.  Note that modifying the
Windows registry is dangerous, and carelessness here can result
in an unusable system.  Be careful.</p><p>The <tt class="literal">-v</tt> option means "verbose".  For most
commands, this causes additional or lengthier messages to be printed.
Conversely, the <tt class="literal">-q</tt> option supresses error messages,
so you can use the exit status of the program to detect if a key
exists or not (for example).</p><p>You must provide <b class="command">regtool</b> with an 
<span class="emphasis"><em>action</em></span> following options (if any). Currently,
the action must be <tt class="literal">add</tt>, <tt class="literal">set</tt>,
<tt class="literal">check</tt>, <tt class="literal">get</tt>, <tt class="literal">list</tt>,
<tt class="literal">remove</tt>, <tt class="literal">set</tt>, or <tt class="literal">unset</tt>.
</p><p>The <tt class="literal">add</tt> action adds a new key.  The 
<tt class="literal">check</tt> action checks to see if a key exists (the 
exit code of the program is zero if it does, nonzero if it does not).
The <tt class="literal">get</tt> action gets the value of a value of a key,
and prints it (and nothing else) to stdout.  Note: if the value
doesn't exist, an error message is printed and the program returns a
non-zero exit code.  If you give <tt class="literal">-q</tt>, it doesn't
print the message but does return the non-zero exit code.</p><p>
The <tt class="literal">list</tt> action lists the subkeys and values
belonging to the given key. With <tt class="literal">list</tt>, the 
<tt class="literal">-k</tt> option instructs <b class="command">regtool</b>
to print only KEYs, and the <tt class="literal">-l</tt> option to print
only VALUEs. The <tt class="literal">-p</tt> option postfixes a 
<tt class="literal">'/'</tt> to each KEY, but leave VALUEs with no
postfix.  The <tt class="literal">remove</tt> action 
removes a key.  Note that you may need to remove everything in the key 
before you may remove it, but don't rely on this stopping you from 
accidentally removing too much.  
</p><p>The <tt class="literal">set</tt> action sets a value within a key.
<tt class="literal">-b</tt> means it's binary data (REG_BINARY).
The binary values are specified as hex bytes in the argument list.
If the argument is <tt class="literal">'-'</tt>, binary data is read
from stdin instead.
<tt class="literal">-e</tt> means it's an expanding string (REG_EXPAND_SZ)
that contains embedded environment variables.  
<tt class="literal">-i</tt> means the value is an integer (REG_DWORD).
<tt class="literal">-m</tt> means it's a multi-string (REG_MULTI_SZ).  
<tt class="literal">-s</tt> means the value is a string (REG_SZ).
If you don't specify one of these, <b class="command">regtool</b> tries to
guess the type based on the value you give.  If it looks like a
number, it's a DWORD.  If it starts with a percent, it's an expanding
string.  If you give multiple values, it's a multi-string.  Else, it's
a regular string.
The <tt class="literal">unset</tt> action removes a value from a key.
</p><p>The <tt class="literal">load</tt> action adds a new subkey and loads
the contents of a registry hive into it.
The parent key must be HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or HKEY_USERS.
The <tt class="literal">unload</tt> action unloads the file and removes
the subkey.
</p><p>The <tt class="literal">save</tt> action saves a subkey into a
registry hive.
</p><p>
By default, the last "\" or "/" is assumed to be the separator between the
key and the value.  You can use the <tt class="literal">-K</tt> option to provide 
an alternate key/value separator character.

SSP - The Single Step Profiler
</p><p>
Original Author:  DJ Delorie 
</p><p>
The SSP is a program that uses the Win32 debug API to run a program
one ASM instruction at a time.  It records the location of each
instruction used, how many times that instruction is used, and all
function calls.  The results are saved in a format that is usable by
the profiling program <b class="command">gprof</b>, although 
<b class="command">gprof</b> will claim the values
are seconds, they really are instruction counts.  More on that later.
</p><p>
Because the SSP was originally designed to profile the cygwin DLL, it
does not automatically select a block of code to report statistics on.
You must specify the range of memory addresses to keep track of
manually, but it's not hard to figure out what to specify.  Use the
"objdump" program to determine the bounds of the target's ".text"
section.  Let's say we're profiling cygwin1.dll.  Make sure you've
built it with debug symbols (else <b class="command">gprof</b> won't run) 
and run objdump like this:

</p><pre class="screen">
$ objdump -h cygwin1.dll
</pre><p>

It will print a report like this:
</p><pre class="screen">
cygwin1.dll:     file format pei-i386

Sections:
Idx Name          Size      VMA       LMA       File off  Algn
  0 .text         0007ea00  61001000  61001000  00000400  2**2
                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, READONLY, CODE, DATA
  1 .data         00008000  61080000  61080000  0007ee00  2**2
                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, DATA
  . . .
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The only information we're concerned with are the VMA of 
the .text section and the VMA of the section after it 
(sections are usually contiguous; you can also add the 
Size to the VMA to get the end address).  In this case, 
the VMA is 0x61001000 and the ending address is either 
0x61080000 (start of .data method) or 0x0x6107fa00 (VMA+Size
method).
</p><p>
There are two basic ways to use SSP - either profiling a whole
program, or selectively profiling parts of the program.
</p><p>
To profile a whole program, just run <b class="command">ssp</b> without options.  
By default, it will step the whole program.  Here's a simple example, using 
the numbers above:

</p><pre class="screen">
$ ssp 0x61001000 0x61080000 hello.exe
</pre><p>

This will step the whole program.  It will take at least 8 minutes on
a PII/300 (yes, really).  When it's done, it will create a file called
"gmon.out".  You can turn this data file into a readable report with
<b class="command">gprof</b>:

</p><pre class="screen">
$ gprof -b cygwin1.dll
</pre><p>

The "-b" means 'skip the help pages'.  You can omit this until you're
familiar with the report layout.  The <b class="command">gprof</b> documentation 
explains a lot about this report, but <b class="command">ssp</b> changes a few 
things.  For example, the first part of the report reports the amount of time 
spent in each function, like this:

</p><pre class="screen">
Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.
  %   cumulative   self              self     total
 time   seconds   seconds    calls  ms/call  ms/call  name
 10.02    231.22    72.43       46  1574.57  1574.57  strcspn
  7.95    288.70    57.48      130   442.15   442.15  strncasematch
</pre><p>

The "seconds" columns are really CPU opcodes, 1/100 second per opcode.
So, "231.22" above means 23,122 opcodes.  The ms/call values are 10x
too big; 1574.57 means 157.457 opcodes per call.  Similar adjustments
need to be made for the "self" and "children" columns in the second
part of the report.
</p><p>
OK, so now we've got a huge report that took a long time to generate,
and we've identified a spot we want to work on optimizing.  Let's say
it's the time() function.  We can use SSP to selectively profile this
function by using OutputDebugString() to control SSP from within the
program.  Here's a sample program:

</p><pre class="screen">
	#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
	main()
	{
	  time_t t;
	  OutputDebugString("ssp on");
	  time(&amp;t);
	  OutputDebugString("ssp off");
	}
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Then, add the <tt class="literal">-d</tt> option to ssp to default to 
*disabling* profiling.  The program will run at full speed until the first 
OutputDebugString, then step until the second.
You can then use <b class="command">gprof</b> (as usual) to see the performance 
profile for just that portion of the program's execution.
</p><p>
There are many options to ssp.  Since step-profiling makes your
program run about 1,000 times slower than normal, it's best to
understand all the options so that you can narrow down the parts
of your program you need to single-step.
</p><p>
<tt class="literal">-v</tt> - verbose.  This prints messages about threads 
starting and stopping, OutputDebugString calls, DLLs loading, etc.
</p><p>
<tt class="literal">-t</tt> and <tt class="literal">-c</tt> - tracing.  
With <tt class="literal">-t</tt>, *every* step's address is written
to the file "trace.ssp".  This can be used to help debug functions,
since it can trace multiple threads.  Clever use of scripts can match
addresses with disassembled opcodes if needed.  Warning: creates
*huge* files, very quickly.  <tt class="literal">-c</tt> prints each address to 
the console, useful for debugging key chunks of assembler.  Use 
<tt class="literal">addr2line -C -f -s -e foo.exe &lt; trace.ssp &gt; lines.ssp</tt>
and then <tt class="literal">perl cvttrace</tt> to convert to symbolic traces.
</p><p>
<tt class="literal">-s</tt> - subthreads.  Usually, you only need to trace the 
main thread, but sometimes you need to trace all threads, so this enables that.
It's also needed when you want to profile a function that only a
subthread calls.  However, using OutputDebugString automatically
enables profiling on the thread that called it, not the main thread.
</p><p>
<tt class="literal">-l</tt> - dll profiling.  Generates a pretty table of how much 
time was spent in each dll the program used.  No sense optimizing a function in
your program if most of the time is spent in the DLL.
I usually use the <tt class="literal">-v</tt>, <tt class="literal">-s</tt>, and 
<tt class="literal">-l</tt> options:

</p><pre class="screen">
$ ssp <tt class="literal">-v</tt> <tt class="literal">-s</tt> <tt class="literal">-l</tt> <tt class="literal">-d</tt> 0x61001000 0x61080000 hello.exe

session in a new window, for example:

</p><pre class="screen">
$ strace -o tracing_output -w sh -c 'while true; do echo "tracing..."; done' &amp;
</pre><p>
This is particularly useful for <b class="command">strace</b> sessions that
take a long time to complete.
</p><p>
Note that <b class="command">strace</b> is a standalone Windows program and so does 
not rely on the Cygwin DLL itself (you can verify this with 
<b class="command">cygcheck</b>). As a result it does not understand symlinks.
This program is mainly useful for debugging the Cygwin DLL itself.</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="umount"></a>umount</h3></div></div><div></div></div><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>The <b class="command">umount</b> program removes mounts from the
mount table.  If you specify a POSIX path that corresponds to a
current mount point, <b class="command">umount</b> will remove it from the
system registry area.  (Administrator priviledges are required).
The <tt class="literal">-u</tt> flag may be used to specify removing the mount 
from the user-specific registry area instead.</p><p>The <b class="command">umount</b> utility may also be used to remove
all mounts of a particular type.  With the extended options it is
possible to remove all mounts (<tt class="literal">-A</tt>), all 
cygdrive automatically-mounted mounts (<tt class="literal">-c</tt>), all
mounts in the current user's registry area (<tt class="literal">-U</tt>), 
or all mounts in the system-wide registry area (<tt class="literal">-S</tt>) 
(with Administrator privileges).</p><p>See <a href="using-utils.html#mount" title="mount">the section called &#8220;mount&#8221;</a> for more information on the mount
