# $Id: NEWS,v 1.13 2004/02/01 06:48:03 cwilson Exp $

Version v2_03:
  1. Make cygipc coexist more peacefully with new cygserver
     implementation.
  2. Add semstat, semtool, shmtool, msgtool, ipcs, and ipcrm 
     back to cygipc distribution.  Official package will rename
     these files via packaging script so that they don't clash
     with the cygserver-based ones from cygwin and cygutils.

Version v2_02:
  1. Better shutdown behavior (Jason Tishler)

Version v2_01:
  1. Build libcygipc as a DLL
  2. Rename ipc-daemon to ipc-daemon2

Version v2_00:
  1. Much improvement in the shm code (Michael Haubenwallne)
     a. shm handles forks
     b. shm works better with multiprocess (the whole point,
        after all...)
  2. General bugfixes (Joe Buehler, MH)
  3. semctl(SETALL) now conforms to the standard (MH)
  4. semctl(GETALL) implemented (MH)
  5. semaphores now persistent until explicitly removed, or
     system reboot/ipc-daemon shutdown. (JB)
  6. Automatic removal of /tmp/MultiFileXXX files on daemon 
     shutdown (MH)
  
Version v1_90:
CHANGES from the v1_14 branch
  1. GO BACK to 64 bit key_t!
  2. Use the ftok() exported by cygwin-1.5.x; don't
     provide private version.
  3. remove ipck, ipcs, and ipcrm from the distro 
     (now provided by cygutils)
  4. remove semtool, shmtool, and msgtool (have been
     in cygutils for a while)

---- BRANCH POINT --- 

CHANGES from v1_13 to v_14
  1. quote-protect the program path, so that ipc-daemon
     can live in 'Program Files/' (Przemyslaw Sztoch)
  2. Some corrections to verboseness-level handling.
  3. Fix a problem with kernel object namespaces that
     caused cygipc to fail on XP when using 'Fast User
     Switching'.  Thanks to Jason Tischler and Igor 
     Pechtchanski for fixing this.

CHANGES from v1_12 to v1_13
  1. REVERT 64bit key_t CHANGES!!!!!!!!!!
     This release is STILL BINARY COMPATIBLE with all
     previously releassed versions (since 1.12 was never
     really released)
  2. REVERT ipc-daemon2 name changes.  Still use the
     ipc-daemon names.
  3. --quiet and --debug are deprecated (but still present). 
     Instead, use --verbose=0 (e.g. quiet), --verbose=1 (e.g.
     normal default), or --verbose=2 (e.g. debug).
  4. Some functions now return ENOSYS instead of EACCESS
     (Jason Tischler)
  5. Fix bug in recording the verboseness level in the
     registry, when --install-as-service
  6. Quote-protect the program path, so that ipc-daemon
     can live in "Program Files" when --install-as-service

CHANGES from v1_11 to v1_12
  1. Adapt to the new 64bit definition of key_t in newlib
     ----- BREAKS BINARY COMPATIBILITY -----
     But then, you can no longer compile against the old
     version on a cygwin-1.3.X system, where X >= 11.
     So, this change was absolutely necessary given the
     changes in cygwin.

  2. Rename deamon to 'ipc-daemon2.exe'; use different
     ID strings and filenames to avoid conflicts with
     concurrently running old 'ipc-daemon.exe'.

     Old programs, linked against cygipc-1.11 or below, 
     will still continue to work on cygwin-1.3.11+ 
     systems, using the old ipc-daemon.exe.  However, 
     to compile new programs against cygipc on cygwin-1.3.11+
     MUST use the new cygipc-1.12 version of the cygipc
     library, and will require that 'ipc-daemon2.exe' be running.

     You can have both ipc-daemon.exe and ipc-daemon2.exe 
     running on the same system -- but information will not
     be shared between them (e.g. a program running in the
     ipc-daemon "space" cannot communicated to a program 
     running in the ipc-daemon2 "space".
	  
  3. Changes for VPATH building

  4. --quiet and --debug are deprecated (but still present). 
     Instead, use --verbose=0 (e.g. quiet), --verbose=1 (e.g.
     normal default), or --verbose=2 (e.g. debug).

CHANGES from v1_10 to v1_11
  1. remove definition of 'union semun' from sem.h
  2. add definition of 'union semun' to ipcrm.c, ipcs.c,
     sem.c, contrib/semtool.c
  3. Make fourth argument of semctl() optional (sem.h,
     sem.c)

CHANGES from v1_09 to v1_10
  1. add C++ guards to all public header files (ipc.h, 
     msg.h, sem.h, shm.h, ipctrace.h)
  2. msg.h, sem.h, shm.h now include ipc.h (so you don't
     have to, and as required by SUSv2)
  3. doc updates

CHANGES from v1_08 to v1_09
  1. Fred Yankowski: add huge chunk of code to ipc-daemon 
     that enables it to operate as a service under WinNT/2K, 
     without using srvany or instsrv.
  2. Corinna Vinschen: security-related code to enable
     Fred's ipc-daemon service to successfully operate from 
     the LocalSystem account, rather than requiring daemon
     and client to run from the same account.
  3. Yutaka Tanida: bugfix in semaphore handling and shared 
     memory code
  4. Pete Forman: B20.1 compatibility fix and relocated a 
     #define from public to private headers to prevent 
     conflict with postgresql
  5. CSW: error handling cleanups in the library
     affects msg.c, sem.c, shm.c, strace.c, version.c, 
     and include/sys/ipctrace.h
  6. CSW: take advantage of the errhandling cleanups from
     ipctest and ipc-daemon.
  7. CSW: Improved option handling/help messages 
     in ipc-daemon --- now requires popt library 
  8. CSW: Makefile changes for compatibility with latest 
     w32api package and gcc package.
  9. CSW: MAJOR overhaul of the README and USAGE files to 
     reflect new capabilities in ipc-daemon
 10. CSW: Add a TODO file 

CHANGES from v1_07 to v1_08
  1. msg handling fixes from Malcolm Blue, affecting ipc-daemon,
     ipctest, msg.c, and include/sys/msg.h
  2. add documentation from Linux Programmer's Guide
     Chapter 6 (doc/*.html, doc/*.gif)
  3. add contrib/ directory with tools from LPG. 
     contrib/Makefile and contrib/README are original [CSW]
  4. Don't install IpcNt*.h files; these are library-private
     Suggestion from Pete Forman
  5. README updates

CHANGES from v1_06 (or v1_05) to v1_07
  1. W2K fixes from Andrea Malagoli and Pete Forman

  3. build cleanups
  4. added COPYING file, NEWS file, ChangeLog file (empty
     for now) 
  5. README --> README.old
  
CHANGES from v1_05 to v1_06
  1. various W2K fixes from Andrea Malagoli (Andrea named his
     vesion 1.06, so to avoid confusion "my" 1.06 was never
