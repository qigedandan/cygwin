To link this library with your projects:
 1. include sys/ipc.h, and one or more of:
    ( sys/msg.h, sys/sem.h, and sys/shm.h )
 2. for debugging and error redirection, also
    include sys/ipctrace.h.  See NOTES below.
 3. Compile using -I/usr/include/cygipc 
 4. link with the static library using '-lcygipc'

The daemon (ipc-daemon2.exe) must be running before programs that
require IPC services are started.  You can run it from your 
Startup folder, from the explorer, or as a service (on NT/2K).  
You can also start it from within a bash shell or dos box, but 
it will not survive the death of its parent terminal in that 
case (in other words, don't close the window).

If started from a `naked' dosbox (e.g. not from bash), then you
will not be able to see any debug or help messages unless you 
use this workaround (see the README for an indepth discussion):

   ipc-daemon2 [OPTIONS] 2>&1 | cat

Also, see the README file for information concerning running 
ipc-daemon2 as a service (NT/2K only). (Do NOT attempt to 
call ipc-daemon2 with the '--service' option -- it will not
do what you think...)
