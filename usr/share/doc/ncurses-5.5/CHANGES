	* update to 5.4, latest official patchset
	* build using libtool (yay!)
	  - requires bump to version 8
	  - but very few other changes

2003-Jul-30  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* update to latest official patchset
	* add patches from Nicholas Wourms for libtool support
	  doesn't completely work, yet, but it's getting there.

2003-Jul-15  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* Fix ordering bug in postinstall script
	* Update docs.

2003-Mar-07  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* update to the 5.3 source.  Most of the support
	needed to build shared libs on cygwin has been added
	-- in much different form -- to the main dist.  However,
	this difference means that the ABI has once again 
	changed.

	* There is no longer a C++ shared library.  It's not
	really necessary, anyway, since it doesn't save that
	much disk space and, and a shared library would have
	ALL of the other ncurses libs as direct dependencies.
	Which means that you'd always need to link in -lpanel
	even when you don't use that portion of the C++ code,
	for instance.  The ncurses maintainer has removed
	almost all existing support for building libncurses++
	as a shared lib on every platform; I'm not going to
	add it back in just for cygwin.

	* split the dist into 4 separate packages (not counting
	the forked terminfo package): ncurses, libncurses-devel,
	libncurses7, and ncurses-demo.

2002-Jan-07  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* form/Makefile.in: add bindir, INSTALL_PROGRAM, create
	bindir in DESTDIR (to minimize dll patch size)
	* menu/Makefile.in: ditto
	* panel/Makefile.in: ditto
	* ncurses/Makefile.in: ditto
	* test/Makefile.in: add DYN version of the LOCAL_LIBS list
	* c++/Makefile.in: add bindir, INSTALL_PROGRAM, create
	bindir in DESTDIR. Split LIB_OBJS into two groups -- 
	cursesmain.o can't be included in the DLL, but must be 
	ar'ed onto the import lib.
	* CYGWIN-PATCHES/ncurses-build: remove (replaced
	by external ncurses-VER-REL.sh buildscript)
	* CYGWIN-PATCHES/ncurses-5.2.README: remove

	variable for curses.h.in, above

2001-Sep-29  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* -dll.patch: no longer use --enable-auto-import
	(because latest binutils has that as default).
	no longer use --enable-auto-image-base (on rare
	occaisions, causes conflicts with cygwin1.dll)
	* CYGWIN-PATCHES/ncurses-5.2.README: update accordingly
	* CYGWIN-PATCHES/ncurses-build: update pkg version

2001-Sep-13  Charles Wilson  <cwilson@ece.gatech.edu>

	* disk.mk: add NCURSES_ABI variable; bump to '6'

	* ncurses-5.2-3 release

2000-Dec-5  Steven O'Brien  steven_obrien@lineone.net

	* c++/cursesapp.h: Due to a gcc bug, static data
	members do not pick up the NCURSES_IMPEXP decoration

	* c++/cursesp.h: ditto
	* c++/cursesw.h: ditto
	* c++/cursslk.h: ditto
