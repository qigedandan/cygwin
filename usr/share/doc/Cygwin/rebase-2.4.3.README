Abstract:

The Cygwin rebase distribution contains two utilities, rebase and
rebaseall.  The first utility is modeled after Microsoft's SDK rebase:

    http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/tools/tools/rebase.asp

However, instead of linking rebase against Microsoft's imagehlp library,
it is linked against Ralf Habacker's imagehelper library.

The following are the advantages of using Ralf's library:

    1. rebase can be a Cygwin application.  If rebase is linked against
       Microsoft's imagehlp library, then it must be a Mingw application.
       This is because imagehlp is dependent on Microsoft's C runtime and
       therefore cannot be used in an application that is dependent on
       another C runtime (i.e., Cygwin).

    2. rebase can be used on Windows Me.  For some reason, Microsoft's
       imagehlp.dll does not function properly on this platform.

    3. Ralf's imagehelper library also provides FixImage() which fixes
       bad relocations in DLLs that can be caused by stripping.

I would like to thank Ralf Habacker for providing the imagehelper
library.  This library has enabled me to create a rebase utility that
is usable by all Cygwin user (regardless of platform) on all DLLs
(regardless of stripping).

The rebaseall utility is a convenient way for users that suffer from the
Cygwin rebase problem to rebase their entire system (i.e., all of their
DLLs).  The following is a list of known Cygwin applications that are
affected by the rebase problem:

    Apache
    Perl
    Python

The rebase problem is due to fork() failing when it is unable to load
DLLs in the child at the same address as in the parent.  This is caused
by DLLs which have conflicting base addresses.  An error message like
the following will be displayed when the problem is triggered:

    C:\cygwin\bin\python.exe: *** unable to remap C:\cygwin\bin\cygssl.dll to same address as parent(0xDF0000) != 0xE00000

Note that rebaseall is only a stop-gap measure.  Eventually the rebase
functionality will be added to Cygwin's setup.exe, so that rebasing will
happen automatically.

Requirements:

The following packages or later are required to build and/or execute
Cygwin rebase and/or rebaseall:

    ash 20040127-3
    binutils 20030307-1
    cygwin 1.5.7-1
    fileutils 4.1-2
    gcc 3.2-3
    grep 2.5-1
    gzip 1.3.5-1
    sed 4.0.7-2

Install:

Cygwin rebase does not require any special installation procedures.

Usage:

Use the following procedure to rebase your entire system:

    1. shutdown all Cygwin processes and services
    2. start ash (do not use bash or rxvt)
    3. execute /bin/rebaseall (in the ash window)

If you get any errors due to DLLs being in-use or read-only, then take the
appropriate action and rerun rebaseall.  Otherwise, you run the risk of fork()
failing.

The following is the rebaseall command line syntax:

    rebaseall [-b BaseAddress] [-o Offset] [-T FileList | -] [-v]

where:

    -b => base address used by rebase (default: 0x70000000)
    -o => offset between each DLL rebased (default: 0x10000)
    -s => specify DLL suffix, use multiple if necessary (default: dll, so)
    -T => specify filelist (or stdin) to list additional files
    -v => verbose (default: off)

The following is the rebase command line syntax:

    rebase -b BaseAddress [-Vdv] [-o Offset] [-T FileList | -] Files...

where:

    -b => base address used by rebase
    -d => rebase down memory (default: up)
    -o => offset between each DLL rebased
    -T => specify filelist (or stdin) to list additional files
    -V => display version and exit
    -v => verbose (default: off)

Source:

Cygwin rebase builds OOTB under Cygwin.  With minor Makefile tweaking,
it builds cleanly under Mingw too.

Build:

See build.sh in the source archive for my exact build recipe for configuring,
making, and packaging this distribution.

Test:

rebase does not contain any regression tests.

Issues:

The following are the known Cygwin rebase issues:

1. rebase should be integrated with Cygwin's setup.exe.

2. rebase does not handle in-use DLLs.

3. rebase does not currently store the DLL base addresses in a database
which would speed up and/or obviate subsequent rebases.

4. rebase skips read-only DLLs.
