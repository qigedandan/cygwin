Build instructions:
  unpack gettext-0.15-X-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be unpacked
    under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport ./gettext-0.15-X.cygport all

This will create:
  /usr/src/gettext-0.15-X-src.tar.bz2

Port Notes:
----------  gettext-0.15-1 -- 21 Oct 2006 -----------
* Update to latest official release
* Uses the True Bruno Method for dealing with Woe32
* built using cygport framework

----------  gettext-0.15.pre2-1 -- 01May2006 ----------- UNRELEASED
* Update to the latest release
* Adapt to The One True Bruno Way: --disable-auto-import
  = alternate solution for .rdata 'const struct'
  = alternate solution to reloc fixes
  = But incomplete, so needed more cygwin-foo provided here.
* java removed.
* new sub-package: libasprintf0 contains cygasprintf-0.dll
  Although the header, import, and static libraries have long
  been, and still are, included in the gettext subpackage, they
  were fairly useless without the runtime library.  </shame>
 
----------  gettext-0.14.5-1 -- 10Nov2005 -----------
* Update to the latest release.
* Built with gcj installed -- /usr/share/gettext/gnu.gettext.*.exe
  demo programs (compiled java).
* Internal build changes -- private getopt functions no longer
  in static convenience lib, but are part of libgettextsrc.la 
  shared lib.  This magic made possible by gnulib m4 stuff now
  present in upstream release.  Still need a little cygwin-foo,
  but not as much.
* Use /proc/self/exe instead of /proc/<pid>/exename, now that the
  former is available (cygwin-1.5.13+) [falls back to the latter
  if necessary]
* Other fixes necessary for working around .rdata 'const struct'
  problem (http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004-09/msg01101.html)
  especially with getopt long_options structures.

0.14.1-1:
---------------------
Update to the latest release.  DLL version number of libintl was
bumped to '3' (upstream change).

0.12.1-1:
---------------------
Update to the latest release.  Also, now that libtool doesn't relink
forever, use cyggettextlib-0-12-1.dll and cyggettextsrc-0-12-1.dll.
Now, the odd thing about this is, cyggettext*-0-12-1 are PRIVATE
libraries.  Their version number will change with every new release,
but since nobody (outside of this package) is allowed to use them,
there's no need to worry about backwards compatibility and keeping
old versions around and -- you would think -- no need to put them
into their own package.

BUT.  cyggettextpo-0.dll provides the PUBLIC interface to those 
two private libraries.  Thus, external packages might depend on
cyggettextpo-0.dll (which in turn depends on cyggettextlib-X-Y-Z
and cyggettextsrc-X-Y-Z, but they don't know that).  Thus, 
cyggettextpo-0.dll needs to be in its own package -- AND 
cyggettextsrc-X-Y-Z.dll / cyggettextlib-X-Y-Z.dll need to be with
it.  Thus, later versions of gettextpo will look like this:

  libgettextpo0 (first)
    cyggettextpo-0.dll
    cyggettextsrc-0-12-1.dll
    cyggettextlib-0-12-1.dll
  libgettextpo0 (next, but public interface gettextpo hasn't changed)
    cyggettextpo-0.dll
    cyggettextsrc-0-12-2.dll
    cyggettextlib-0-12-2.dll
  etc.

External packages keep seeing cyggettextpo-0.dll, but behind the scenes
the private library versions keep changing.  But they MUST be 
distributed together with the public lib, or the whole thing breaks.

Sigh.

0.11.5-1:
---------------------
Updated to the latest release, which includes the new "autopoint" 
program.  Added the CYGWIN-PATCHES/javac and the CYGWIN-PATCHES/java
wrapper scripts, to help in building the .jar files.
  -- this requires manual intervention: edit the scripts as appropriate
     and then copy them into your path -- ahead of the "real" javac.exe
     and java.exe.
  -- also, I ran the following commands manually:
       cd <topsrc>/intl-java
       javadoc -d javadoc1 gnu/gettext/*.java
       javadoc -d javadoc2 gnu/gettext/*.java

0.11.2-2:
---------------------
Rebuilt against the new libiconv package, as well as expat.
Updated the requires: lines in the hints.

0.11.2-1:
---------------------
Between 0.10.40 and 0.11.2, there were massive changes in the
gettext package.  Much of the code for the development tools
was pulled out and placed into two additional libraries,
libgettextlib and libgettextsrc.  These are NOT for use by 
outside programs, but only by the gettext tools themselves --
so the header files, static lib, and import lib are NOT 
included in the binary package (this ommission is actually
*recommended* by Bruno in the PACKAGING file).
  However, in general these two support libraries are built as
shared libraries (DLLs), so the cyggettextlib-0.11.2.dll and
cyggettextsrc-0.11.2.dll files are installed.  Also, these
libraries are NOT versioned according to the normal libtool
method (--version-info x:y:z), but instead are versioned
using the --release 0.11.2 method.  That means that every
new release of gettext will ship new versions (0.11.3, etc)
of these two libs -- and since no package other than 
gettext itself uses them, we don't need to worry about 
keeping old versions around for compatibility and stuff.
  So, I've made all of the necessary changes to enable
these two libs to be built as DLLs -- which include:
  1) use the functional, not macro, form of po_gram_error
     and po_gram_error_at_line.  Otherwise, our client
     programs msg*.exe will attempt, via the macro, to
     directly access fields of the imported structure variable
     gram_pos.
       changes: src/po-lex.h src/po-lex.c
  2) provide an accessor function for the imported 
     array-of-structures variable plural_table[] (otherwise
     our client programs will attempt to directly access
     elements of the table -- a no-no for auto-import).
       changes: src/plural-table.h src/plural-table.c
                src/msgfmt.c src/msginit.c
  3) pull out the getopt functions from these libraries, 
     and put them into their own libgetopt.a convenience
     library.   This is because cygwin itself provides the
     getopt functions, and 
       (a) if a function is listed in TWO import libs, ld
           reports an error.  /usr/lib/libcygwin.a and
           libgettextlib.dll.a would both contain the getopt
           symbols, so we remove them.
       (b) BUT, we CAN'T use the version provided by cygwin!!
           Cygwin's version hardcodes the POSIXLY_CORRECT variable,
           which means we cannot reorder options and arguments --
           but gettext's tests rely on reordering.
       (c) We CAN override functions that might be imported from
           a dll via an import lib by using an explicit STATIC
           lib.  So, 
     getopt.c getopt.h getopt1.c  all go into the convenience lib
     libgetopt.la instead of the regular lib libgettextlib.la.
     (Recall that convenience libs are always built statically).
	  Add libgetopt.la as a dependence for all exe's.
	    changes: src/Makefile.am  lib/Makefile.am  tests/Makefile.am

However, as it turned out, this was all for naught.  Because
libtool still has problems on cygwin when relinking DLL's for
installation, I finally just forced libgettextsrc.la and libgettextlib.la
to be built statically as convenience libs themselves.  The above
changes WERE enough to build working exe's and dll's that passed
most of the selftests -- but 'make install' wouldn't work because
libtool kept trying to relink the DLLs against /usr/lib, not
$(DESTDIR)/usr/lib.  It's a libtool problem, not a gettext problem.

So, ultimately, we don't ship or build cyggettext*.dll.  This means
that the msg*.exe and xgettext.exe programs are slightly bigger
than necessary, but only by about 300k or so, total.

Also, the gettext package was split into three packages instead of
just two: 
  'gettext' contains the core utilities
  'libintl2' (yes, the DLL version got bumped) contains just the 
             single cygintl-2.dll file -- and even if we DID build 
             cyggettext*.dll, they wouldn't go in the libintl package. 
  'gettext-devel' contains development utilities, autotool macros, 
             additional documentation, etc.
This split was recommended by Bruno in the PACKAGING file.

0.10.40-1:
---------------------
  Note that the configure step (if you use the build script) will 
  erroneously report that the autotools are missing.  This is 
  because the cygwin auto-wrappers fail when the build directory 
  doesn't contain configure.in|ac.  We could correct this by
  copying configure.in into our .build dir, (manually or inside
  the build script) but why bother?

As of 0.10.38-3, the dll has been renamed to cygintl-1.dll; the new dll
  is not backward compatible with previous versions because it is now
  built using auto-export/auto-import functionality.  Benefit: no more
  need for -DGETTEXT_STATIC when linking client libs statically.

The utility and test programs are statically linked.  To build dynamically
  linked versions, follow these steps:

  short version :-)
    gettext-0.10.38-X.sh all_dyn
 
  long version:
    gettext-0.10.38-X.sh prep
    gettext-0.10.38-X.sh conf
    gettext-0.10.38-X.sh build
    gettext-0.10.38-X.sh check (tests static lib & exe's)
    Then

    edit <topsrc>/.build/src/Makefile and remove the '-static' flag from LDFLAGS
    edit <topsrc>/.build/tests/Makefile and remove the '-static' flag from LDFLAGS
    cp <topsrc>/.build/intl/libintl.dll.a <topsrc>/.build/intl/.libs/libintl.a
    cp <topsrc>/.build/intl/cygintl.dll   <topsrc>/.build/src/
    cp <topsrc>/.build/intl/cygintl.dll   <topsrc>/.build/tests/
    cd <topsrc>/.build/src
    rm *.exe
    cd <topsrc>/.build/tests
    rm *.exe

    And finally

    gettext-0.10.38-X.sh build
    gettext-0.10.38-X.sh check (tests dynamic lib & exe's)

  Because this is so kludgy -- even when automated by the build_dyn 
  option -- the default build (and the shipped version) is linked
  statically.


Both static and dynamic librarys pass all 25 tests.

------------------
Old, possibly out of data notes:

As of 0.10.35-2, the dll is named "cygintl.dll" NOT "libintl.dll".  This 
  helps to avoid dll naming conflicts between cygwin dll's and 
  dlls from other platforms (native, pw, etc).  If you have an
  executable that depends on "libintl.dll" you may either recompile 
  your app so that it links with libintl.dll.a/cygintl.dll, or install
  *just* the dll from gettext-0.10.35-1.tar.gz into your /usr/bin 
  directory.

The dll is NOT versioned. (i.e. "cygintl.dll" NOT "cygintl1.dll") because
  the libintl package and interface is quite stable, and its interface
  is not anticipated to change in the foreseeable future.

I have built the utility programs using dynamic linking, and they
pass the 'make check' tests.  However, doing this requires manual 
intervention during the build process, and is IMO just not worth it. 
The problem is libtool -- when configure decides that a platform 
doesn't support dynamic linking, a libtool-ized package will go
*out of its way* to make sure you don't try it.

I adjusted the Makefile.am and Makefile.in files *just enough*
so that a working .dll and import library are built, but it's
just too ugly to force the executables that come with gettext
to link to them.  This does NOT, repeat does NOT, imply that it's
harder or less beneficial to use the dll when building *external*
programs that depend on gettext.  It's just hard to do from *inside*
the gettext package.

For those who are interested, to force dynamic linking of the tools:
After building everything else, as directed above, 

  edit src/Makefile.in and remove the '-static' flag from LDFLAGS
  edit src/Makefile.in and remove the '-DGETTEXT_STATIC' flag from DEFS
  edit tests/Makefile.in and remove the '-static' flag from LDFLAGS
  edit tests/Makefile.in and remove the '-DGETTEXT_STATIC' flag from DEFS
    (you may need to do this to src/Makefile; tests/Makefile instead)
  cp lib/libnlsutdyn.a lib/libnlsut.a
  cp intl/libintl.dll.a intl/libintl.a
  cp intl/cygintl.dll src/
  cp intl/cygintl.dll tests/
  cd src
  rm *.o *.exe
  make
  cd ../tests
  rm *.o *.exe
  make
  cd ..
  make check

Both the statically-linked versions of the tools and the 
dynamically-linked versions pass all 25 'make check' tests.
