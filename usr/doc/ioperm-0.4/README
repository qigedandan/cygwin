ioperm support for Cygwin
=========================

This software adds support for ioperm()/iopl() functions to Cygwin. This
support includes sys/io.h and sys/perm.h header files (not included in
Cygwin by default) together with development and runtime libraries.

ioperm package is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License,
and you are welcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under certain
conditions. There is absolutely no warranty for ioperm. Please read COPYING
file for more info.

Warning: Current release of this software may decrease your system security
on Windows NT/2000/XP because enables access to system I/O ports for all
processes, including non-privileged. If you are not sure, please do not use it
on Windows NT/2000/XP.


Download
--------

Source tarball is available from ioperm homepage:
http://openwince.sourceforge.net/ioperm/


Build & install steps
---------------------

For complete informations see INSTALL file. Here are quick install steps:

1. Download and unpack source tarball.
2. Run ./configure script. Optional parameter "--prefix=/usr" is recommended.
3. Run `make`.
4. Run `make install`.
5. Install (activate) ioperm.sys driver using `ioperm -i`.
   This is required only for Windows NT/2000/XP.
6. Run `tests/spkrtest`. This is optional step.


ioperm.sys driver
-----------------

ioperm.sys driver is required for using ioperm()/iopl() functions with
Windows NT/2000/XP. The driver is not required for Windows 95/98/Me.

ioperm.sys must be installed manually using command `ioperm -i`.
For driver uninstallation, please run `ioperm -u`.


Programming
-----------

To use ioperm()/iopl() functions in your Cygwin program, please link your
executable with libioperm.a (-lioperm parameter for linker) or use autoconf
package (see next paragraph).

If you want to write a portable program between Linux and Cygwin, the best way
is to use autoconf package. Then please add this line into your configure.in
or configure.ac file:

AC_SEARCH_LIBS([ioperm], [ioperm])
